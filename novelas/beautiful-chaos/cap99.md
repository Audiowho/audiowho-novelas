# Acknowledgements


This book is only in your hands because Justin Richards and Steve Tribe (editors extraordinaire) worked so hard to get it there. I am very, very grateful to them. More than they realise.

Thanks are due to Russell T Davies, who put me on the right path with Donna and Wilf; to Lee Binding for his inspirational cover; to James North in the Doctor Who Art Department for his research; and the following people who, quite genuinely, kept me sane when I freaked out: John Ainsworth, Edward Russell, Ben Brown, Lindsey Alford, Brian Minchin, Darren Scott and most especially Joe Lidster.

The Many Hands
by Dale Smith
ISBN 978 1 846 07422 6
UK £6.99 US $11.99/$14.99 CDN
The Nor’ Loch is being filled in. If you ask the soldiers
there, they’ll tell you it’s a stinking cesspool that the city
can do without. But that doesn’t explain why the workers
won’t go near the place without an armed guard.


That doesn’t explain why they whisper stories about the
loch giving up its dead, about the minister who walked into
his church twelve years after he died...


It doesn’t explain why, as they work, they whisper about a
man called the Doctor.


And about the many hands of Alexander Monro.

seen the development of space travel between countless
worlds.

Earth’s ventures into space, examines the many alien fleets
who have paid Earth a visit, and explores the other starships

Ghosts of India
by Mark Morris
ISBN 978 1 846 07559 9
UK £6.99 US $11.99/$14.99 CDN
India in 1947 is a country in the grip of chaos – a country
torn apart by internal strife. When the Doctor and Donna
arrive in Calcutta, they are instantly swept up in violent
events.


Barely escaping with their lives, they discover that the city
is rife with tales of ‘half-made men’, who roam the streets
at night and steal people away. These creatures, it is said,
are as white as salt and have only shadows where their eyes
should be.


With help from India’s great spiritual leader, Mohandas
‘Mahatma’ Gandhi, the Doctor and Donna set out to
investigate these rumours.


What is the real truth behind the ‘half-made men’? Why is
Gandhi’s role in history under threat? And has an ancient,
all-powerful god of destruction really come back to wreak
his vengeance upon the Earth?

Sebastiene was perhaps once human. He might look like a

opposition to a planet, then hunting them down for sport.


And now he’s caught them all – from Zargregs to Moogs,
and even the odd Eternal...


In fact, Sebastiene is after only one more prize. For this
trophy, he knows he is going to need help. He’s brought
together the finest hunters in the universe to play the most
dangerous game for the deadliest quarry of them all.


They are hunting for the last of the Time Lords – the
Doctor.
