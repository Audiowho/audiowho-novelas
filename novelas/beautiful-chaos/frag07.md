# SATURDAY

Caitlin stood waiting at Heathrow Airport, Terminal 5, waiting for flights that would once have gone into Terminal 2. That was currently being demolished, ready for the East Terminal that would replace the one European flights used to come into. She was meeting various inbound flights, including one due in from JFK at midday, which would arrive before the European ones. She watched the huge 787-9 jet come in to land, sunlight gleaming off its new fuselage as it slowly crawled to a halt, before taxiing across to the arrival gate and being drawn into position by the small pilot truck.

Caitlin was dressed in a smart Terminal Staff uniform, her access-all-areas pass, with the highest security clearing Madam Delphi could get, dangling from the strap around her neck. She smiled sweetly at a couple of other staff, neither of whom challenged her even though they couldn't possibly have ever seen her before. It was the pass that did that, although Caitlin's long dark hair and blue eyes would have been enough to distract anyone who wanted a closer look. A quick smile was usually all it took Caitlin to get exactly what she wanted.

It was actually a keen security guard who spotted her as she walked through Restricted Access doors towards the arrivals lounge, heading to exactly where she really had no right to be.

'Excuse me?' he called out.

'Is there a problem…' Caitlin screwed up her eyes to read his name tag. 'Is there a problem, Keith?' Keith Brownlow stared at her, his head slightly to one side as if sizing her up. 'Not seen you before,' he said quietly.

'Not been here long,' she answered quickly.

'Funny,' he replied. 'I know everyone in this Terminal.

And those I don't know, don't get in here. I need you to leave, I'm afraid, until I can verify you are who you say you are.' Caitlin paused for a moment, trying to remember a name. 'I'm sure if you check with Mr Golding he'll vouch for me. I joined his staff on Thursday.' Keith shrugged. 'And I'll do that, but only once you go back the way you came and wait in the Yellow Zone.' 'You're very good at this, Keith, aren't you?' 'We take security very seriously,' he said.

'Of course you do,' purred Caitlin. 'Quite right too. But look, there's only you and me here, you've seen my pass, you can see I have clearance. I'm sure it's just administration that have failed to inform you I'm here. I really need to be the other side of that door to greet some VIPs.' Keith ignored her, his right hand resting on the holstered revolver at his hip, his left hand raising his walkie-talkie.

'Oh dear, and I thought we might become friends,' Caitlin said, raising her right arm and sending a bolt of purple energy into Keith's chest, reducing him to ashes before he could even register the movement.

She walked forward, her high heels squashing the few ashes that remained into the carpet. With a quick, deep breath, she pushed open the VIP area doors and marched out to greet her guests.

They were standing, waiting for her, neither of them really seeming to register where they were or what they were doing. Two old Americans, in from New York.

'Mr and Mrs DiCotta? Congratulations on your wedding and welcome to your honeymoon.' Donnie and Portia DiCotta said nothing, just nodded as Caitlin led them to one of the service buggies that elderly and disabled passengers were moved around the airport terminals in.

A confused handler looked at her pass as she flashed it at him, but then moved on, allowing her to take the buggy.

The DiCottas climbed on board as the handler turned back.

'Do they have luggage?' he called out.

Caitlin smiled her sweetest smile, which she hoped didn't suggest what she thought ('Oh, do go away, you pointless oaf'), then said aloud, 'It's been delayed at JFK so we'll come back for it in the morning.' She started the buggy up and drove forward. 'You're the first,' she said quietly, no longer all sweetness and smiles.

'Where are the others?' 'The Greek is in shortly, the Italian group, not for another hour or so. We'll wait, collect them and then go to Madam Delphi together. She has a mission for you tonight.' Caitlin gave a little laugh. 'I would ask about jetlag, but I imagine Madam Delphi has ensured you feel none of that.' 'We feel fine,' said Portia DiCotta.

'Good,' Caitlin said. 'Perfect.' The buggy carried on, away from the main routes and across to another Gate where the flight from Athens International would arrive. 'And then we're off to meet the funky 787-3 from Aeroporto Leonardo da Vinci di Fiumicino,' she said. 'I do hope you enjoy your stay. It'll be brief but very dramatic.' The little buggy trundled on down the long corridors ready to collect more of the army that Madam Delphi would eventually use to bring the human race to utter destruction.

Donna was adjusting the Doctor's tie. She'd done this a hundred times for her dad, especially towards the end, which had given him an excuse to be grouchy and feel useless. The Doctor had no such excuse, but it hadn't stopped him moaning about it.

'Donna, I can tie a tie, you know.' 'Really? Cos I've seen no evidence of that,' was her response, followed by an overenthusiastic shove of the knot a bit too close to the Doctor's Adam's apple.

'Whoops,' she smiled at him. 'So sorry.' He slid a finger down his shirt collar and somehow that single gesture seemed not only to loosen the knot, but also to undo his top button and then put creases into the shirt as well.

It was an art, he said. Geek chic, he said. Scruffy Arthur, she called it, giving up on a lost cause.

'How's Netty getting on?' he asked.

'She's OK today,' Donna said. 'Granddad's fussing round her. Mum's speaking through gritted teeth because of it, so Netty's hopped off early and said she'll meet us there. I reckon she's gone to buy another daft hat!' 'Your mum's worried about Wilf, that's all. Netty's great fun but a big responsibility,' the Doctor said.

'I know, but Mum doesn't have to be so negative about it, does she?' The Doctor shrugged. 'She's a mum, Donna. It's their job to find fault with everyone in their family. It's in the handbook.' 'Did your mum criticise everything you do? The way you brushed your hair, the clothes you wore, the friends you hung out with, the music—' 'Yeah, well, it was a bit different for me,' he said quietly.

Donna looked at him and smiled comfortingly. 'Of course it was. Sorry. Didn't think.' 'Oh, it's all right. I'm just saying, give your mum some credit. It's a lot to cope with – she's looked after your granddad alone for a long time. Now he has someone in his life, she's bound to be a bit put out.' 'Oh don't go all Spock on me.' 'Spock?' 'Yeah, child psychologist blokey, or whatever he was.

All about relations between parents and kids.' 'Ah. Dr Spock. Right.' 'Why, is there another Spock that you know?' laughed Donna as she headed out of the spare room. Although she suspected the Doctor hadn't slept a wink in there – he never seemed to need sleep like a normal person.

The Doctor glanced at himself in the mirror. He always thought he looked quite good in a dinner jacket and black tie – he hated bow ties, they made him look like a waiter, going by what happened at other parties, so tonight it was a black tie proper. Course, it meant he now looked like he was going to a funeral, but hey-ho. And what was it with jackets, no matter how he buttoned them up, they always looked like they were too small or too tight, and the trousers never quite reached down to his ankles.

Ah well, it was Wilf's night, not his.

There was a knock on the door. 'Yeah, I'm coming, Donna, give us a minute.' The door opened. It was Donna's mum.

'Ah. Hullo,' he said. She was an intimidating woman and, like most mothers, she clearly didn't like him much.

Was he imagining it or was his cheek starting to ache again? Some mothers he could win over by sheer charm (ah, Jackie Tyler, what are you doing these days?), or by proving that their daughter's faith in him was justified (still got a good right hook, Francine Jones, bless you).

Now there was Sylvia Noble. Full of so much pride, tempered with so much rage, so much frustration. It was as if she never felt quite so in control of her life as she told herself she was, and that made her really angry.

Of course, it couldn't have been easy losing Geoff. The Doctor had only met him once, at Donna's wedding, where he seemed to be the more… temperate of the Noble parents. Now poor Sylvia was trying her best to deal with a wayward daughter who was nowhere near as wayward as Sylvia imagined (she still had no idea where he really took Donna) and an elderly father, who was so determined not to be a burden on his daughter that he became a bigger one by default. Wilf Mott wanted to prove he was independent, strong and twenty years younger than he was, believing it would take pressure of Sylvia; he just didn't realise that Sylvia saw through this and was twice as worried as she would be if he just sat in an armchair all day watching Countdown.

How long was it since the Doctor had sat down and watched Countdown? He used to like Countdown.

'You'll take care of him.' 'You're not coming with us?' Sylvia looked as if she was about to say something, but then she just shook her head slightly. 'Not my thing.' 'But it's your dad…' 'We had a… discussion about that.' 'Ah.' The Doctor could only begin to imagine how that went. 'Are you sure? Because I'm positive he, Donna and Netty would love you–' He stopped. Sylvia was one step away from flinching at the mention of Henrietta Goodhart.

'Look after him, please, Doctor,' she said quietly. 'He's not getting any younger, despite what he thinks.' The Doctor smiled disarmingly. 'Course I will.' 'There's no “course I will” about it with you, Doctor, so don't give me any of your so-called charm and flannel.

I wasn't asking a question, I was telling you.' The Doctor tried not to smile – it was like being told off by a headmistress. Then the glint in Sylvia's eye reminded him this was not remotely funny.

'Promise,' he said, mentally adding, 'And I'll do three hundred lines: “I will not lose members of the Noble family in London”.' 'They're all I have,' she said and walked out of the room.

The Doctor licked his forefinger and held it up.

Yup, the room's ambient temperature had indeed dropped several degrees.

Half an hour later, they had piled into a cab. Wilf and Donna sat on the seat, the Doctor on one of those fold- down spare seats. He wriggled uncomfortably on it for the whole journey.

Wilf was dressed up to the nines – silk tie, good shirt, slightly tight jacket that had probably been bought in the early seventies – but was let down by the pair of trainers on his feet.

As if sensing where the Doctor was looking, Wilf held up a tatty carrier bag. Inside it was a pair of black dress shoes. 'They don't half kill the circulation in my feet, so I wear 'em as little time as I can,' he explained.

The Doctor nodded. 'You look nice,' he said to Donna.

'Thanks. Had to borrow something off of Veena, who'd lent it to Mooky, so she had to bring it round this afternoon while you were out getting your suit and – what?' The Doctor grinned. 'Your friends have amazing names.' He laughed gently. 'Mooky.' Donna raised an eyebrow at this. 'You can talk. Mister Ood. Mister Matron Cofelia. Mister Ventraxian Gol- Zeeglar. Where d'you get off thinking my mates' names are funny-sounding, eh?' 'Fair point, although Ood isn't really a name, it's more a sort of species designation, and I… um…' Donna was giving him one of her 'do I look like I care' looks, so he turned to Wilf instead.

'Excited?' 'Too right I am, Doctor. I get a star to myself. Named after me. How great is that?' 'It's more than great, Gramps,' Donna squeezed his hand. 'It's bloody marvellous. Spaceman over there, ask him if anyone's named a star after him.' 'Have they, Doctor?' Whether they had or hadn't was neither here nor there right now. 'Absolutely not,' he told Wilf. 'And I'm very jealous.' 'Yeah,' Wilf leaned forward, so the driver wouldn't hear him. 'Yeah, but you? You get to visit 'em, don't you? You get to go up there.' He turned to Donna and nudged her playfully. 'You make the most of it, my girl.' 'Oh, I am, don't you worry,' she said.

The Doctor nodded. 'Oh, she is, don't you worry at all.' 'I mean, I've seen and done some things in my time, Doctor, but nothing can compare to what you're showing my little girl, eh?' 'Hey, I'm not just a passenger, you know,' Donna smiled. 'I get to make a lot of the decisions about where we go, who we see, how quickly we have to leave again, cos he's gone and upset someone in charge. With an army.

And a big axe. And twelve legs.' 'Ten legs,' the Doctor automatically corrected her.

'Oooh, all right then. Ten legs, and two arms that hung down to the ground. If you're being pedantic. Which you clearly are. Tonight.' The Doctor grinned at them both. 'Maybe we should take you with us on a jaunt one day, Wilf.' 'No!' Both Donna and Wilf had said that together, then looked at each other.

'It's dangerous, Granddad.' 'You go!' 'I'm… I can look after myself. If anything happened to you, what'd Mum do?' 'Kill you?' 'Well, she'd kill him,' Donna nodded at the Doctor. 'I'd get away with being skinned alive. Probably.' 'You said “no” too, Wilf,' the Doctor said.

Wilf looked up at the stars as they drove into South London, crossing Vauxhall Bridge. 'I like to look, Doctor.

I like to look, and imagine and dream. But the reality? All them monsters and guns and stuff? Nah. I prefer my ideas.' The Doctor nodded. 'Very wise. Mind you, you'd be a calming influence on her.' 'Oh I know. She does go on, doesn't she?' 'I am sitting here. Right here,' Donna said.

The Doctor was still talking to Wilf. 'And there's obviously something in her childhood about centipedes, but she won't say what. Cos we went to this one place—' 'Oi!' Wilf laughed. 'Oh I gotta tell you about that. When she was about eight, her dad and I took her up Norfolk way.

To the Broads? Anyway, she was paddling about when—' ' OI!! ' They both looked at Donna. She was pointing to herself. One finger on each hand. At her head.

'As I said. Sat here. Listening. Not liking.' The two men grinned at each other.

'Later,' the Doctor said.

'Later,' Wilf confirmed.

Donna broke them up. 'We're here.' The cab pulled up outside the Society, a huge red-brick building built in early Victorian times, just off the main circus by Vauxhall station.

Donna paid the driver ('You're coughing up on the way home,' she told the Doctor). As the taxi roared away, she straightened her dress, checked her heels and nudged the Doctor, who was staring up at the night sky at the stars.

At the new star Wilf had shown him last night. Which was now brighter than before. And there seemed to be another couple of stars that he didn't think should be there… Donna nudged him again.

'What?' She indicated with her head towards Wilf, who was gripping a lamppost, trying to take off his trainers and hold onto his carrier bag at the same time.

'I can't bend in this thing,' she hissed. 'If I tear it, Veena will knock me into next week. She does the whole martial arts thing.' The Doctor took the bag from Wilf and let the old man lean on him as he slipped his trainers off and replaced them with the dress shoes.

'Sylvia bought these,' he said to the Doctor. 'Bloody things are three sizes too small.' 'No they're not,' Donna said automatically. 'You're not trying.' 'Blimey, when did you turn into your mum?' said Wilf.

Donna opened her mouth to retort, but the Doctor, sensing retreat was the better part of valour, grabbed both their arms and placed himself between them.

'Someone's dinner awaits,' he said and they marched up to the building.

The huge wooden door swung open as they reached the top step and a smartly dressed gentleman, mid-thirties, olive skin, dark hair and eyes that twinkled, waved them in.

'Good evening, Mister Mott,' he said in a slight European accent. 'Miss Noble. Doctor Smith. I am Gianni, Head of Hospitality.' Donna pulled a 'blimey' face. 'He was well rehearsed.' 'Guest of honour,' Wilf said. 'I had to tell them who I was bringing.' Gianni walked them into a small area where a couple of people aged somewhere between sixty and two hundred and eleventy were leaning on a bar. Or possibly the bar was holding them up. Either way, they looked like they were part of the furniture.

Donna wrinkled her nose at the strong smell of Scotch and looked behind them, where another door led to a vast dining area, and a hubbub of noise.

'Do go through,' the Head of Hospitality said, so Donna led the way.
