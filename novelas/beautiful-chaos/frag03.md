Which just added fuel to his passionate loathing for tech. He accepted that he needed it, he just didn't want to understand it. His brain wasn't wired to understand MP3 compressions and 3G and GPS tracking systems. He just wanted to press an ON button and have it all work. Wasn't that what his mum's age group had gone through all that First/Second/Third Generation stuff for? So that he could press buttons and things worked without being out of date in six months and redundant in twelve. On TV they talked about the days when you could click your fingers and doors would open, when you could walk into a room and say 'lights' and a computer would turn everything on, just to the right level.

God. He was his grandmother! Next thing, he'd be saying he couldn't understand pop music and what sex was that person on Popworld? Fifteen, not fifty, Lukas.

So why was he standing in the local branch of Discount Electronics, watching a demonstration of the newest Fourth Generation Processor on some laptop thinner than a piece of cardboard? Because his brother, his 8-year-old, technically savvy, brother Joe had asked him. Well, strictly speaking, Mum had asked him. With Joe's dad gone, just like Lukas's before him, the older boy had become de facto father to his little brother. Which suited Lukas, cos secretly he adored Joe, not that he'd ever tell him that. And cos little brothers needed to know who was boss, and Lukas's power would be lost at the first sign of weakness.

And Joe had acted up really badly after his dad went, getting into trouble at school and on the estate, and Mum had been visited by the police twice.

So Lukas had taken Joe aside and explained as best he could to an 8-year-old that it wasn't Mum's fault his dad had gone, nor was it Joe's, and messing about with the older kids, helping them nick cars and stuff wasn't helping Mum.

After a few months, Joe had calmed down. But now he hung on to Lukas at all times, and kicked off if his big brother didn't take him everywhere. Lukas had even started taking Joe to junior school before heading off to Park Vale High. Which Mum appreciated no end, so that was good.

But occasionally, Lukas wanted to kick off by himself, be alone, not be the responsible one.

Today was a day like that, but here he was with Joe, watching this new demo along with thirty other people, all tucked into a shop that probably safely took ten people at most. God help them if there was a fire.

A large (in every direction) woman moved in front of them, so Lukas hoisted Joe up into his arms so he could see better. This meant Lukas could see nothing. So while Joe (how heavy was he getting?) watched intently, Lukas's gaze drifted round the shop.

A skinny guy in a blue suit was tapping away at a demonstration laptop that was probably going to be out of date by the end of today. The guy was searching for something on the internet -- Lukas could see repeated screens showing a search engine (ooh, technical term!) -- and frowning. He clearly wasn't getting the results he wanted.

The man reached into his pocket and took out a shiny tube, like a marker pen, and pointed it at the screen. At first, Lukas thought he was going to write on the laptop's screen but instead the end of the pen glowed blue, and Lukas watched in amazement as the images on the screen downloaded and changed at a phenomenal rate. No, an impossible rate. The blue-suited man took a pair of thick black glasses out of another pocket and put them on as he stared intently at the changing screens. Surely he couldn't read that fast? He became aware that Lukas was watching him and smiled, almost sheepishly. The shiny pen went back into a pocket, the glasses into another.

Lukas realised his mouth was open, so he snapped it shut.

Blue Suit Guy winked at Lukas and was about to leave the shop, when he reached forward and picked up a leaflet about the demonstration Lukas's little brother was watching. And then he looked at the crowd and wandered over.

Lukas quickly switched his attention back to the demo.

Or at least to the back of Fat Lady's head.

After a few minutes of listening to some blonde droning on about how revolutionary the new computer system was, Blue Suit Guy shrugged and muttered about 'impossible' and 'not on this planet' and 'contradicting the Shadow Proclamation's Eighteenth Protocol', at which point Lukas decided that, shiny pen-thing or not, this guy was probably a nutter. Maybe he should get Joe away from him, just in case the guy had a knife.

Lukas leaned forward to whisper in Joe's ear that maybe it was time to go home, when Blue Suit Guy nudged him.

'So, everyone's inside all the electronics shops, yeah?' 'Sorry?' 'The streets were pretty empty. As I walked along, I realised everyone was in shops like this, watching these demos.' 'Today's the launch,' Lukas found himself explaining.

'Everyone's interested.' 'You're not,' Blue Suit Guy replied.

Lukas shrugged. 'Kid brother is.' 'Ah. I see.' Lukas tried to step away, but was hemmed in by another man on one side and Fat Lady in front.

Blue Suit Guy got his shiny pen out again. 'Don't mind me,' he said.

But Lukas did mind him. A lot.

'Why are you here?' he asked.

Blue Suit Guy shrugged. 'Well, firstly, I'm letting a friend go home for a bit. Secondly, I was wondering why everyone was in here. And fourthly, I'm now really concerned by the technology in that laptop.' Lukas knew he'd regret this. 'And thirdly?' 'Thirdly?' Blue Suit Guy looked confused, and then grinned as if something had popped back into his head.

'Oh yes, thirdly, I came looking for you, Lukas Samuel Carnes.' He held out a hand. 'I'm the Doctor and I'm here to save your life.' Dara Morgan sipped his coffee slowly. Partly because it showed he had good manners, and partly because it was too hot to do anything else. But it probably looked like good manners to Mr Murakami and his delegation.

'So, Mr Morgan,' the Japanese banker was saying, 'do we have a deal?' Dara Morgan's blue eyes twinkled mischievously as he glanced over at Caitlin, standing by the office door. 'What do you think, Cait?' Caitlin walked over, her long legs and short skirt clearly drawing the eye of some of Mr Murakami's entourage but not, Dara Morgan observed, Mr Murakami himself.

Good.

'I think it's a good deal, sir,' she purred. 'If Murakami- San can get the M-TEK out throughout the East by Sunday, it will be… superb.' Dara Morgan flicked his hair out of his eyes. 'Just under two days, 3.30pm Tokyo time. Doable?' Mr Murakami frowned. 'Why Sunday? It's ludicrously short notice.' Dara Morgan just smiled. 'Let's just say, it's what the entire deal hinges on. I need that guarantee, Murakami- San, or I go elsewhere.' 'But that way, you have even less chance of a deal to be in place by then,' the Japanese man said.

Dara Morgan nodded at this. 'I know. But let's face it, with the money that the M-TEK will make, smaller companies than yours, hungrier ones perhaps, will go that extra mile to meet my… MorganTech's requirements.' He sipped his coffee again. 'It'll be in the contract, with penalty clauses.' 'Which will be?' 'Catastrophic. For the whole of Japan.' Mr Murakami's people moved an inch closer to their man. 'Was that a threat, Mr Morgan?' he asked softly.

'No,' said Dara Morgan. 'I don't do threats. Barbarians do threats. Idiots do threats. I just state facts.' 'It is a great opportunity,' Caitlin cut in. 'Please, think about it over dinner. Tonight. At our expense.' 'Alas, we cannot join you,' Dara Morgan added, 'but you are at liberty to pick any restaurant in London that takes your fancy and all expenses will be covered by MorganTech. Indeed I insist.' 'All expenses?' 'Relating to food and drink, yes.' 'Ah. In that case, you shall have my answer by midnight tonight.' Mr Murakami stood and Dara Morgan did the same, giving a slight bow as he did so. Mr Murakami responded likewise, including Caitlin in the deference, and she nodded to him and the others in his party.

Formalities over, the Japanese delegation headed for the door of the suite, but Mr Murakami turned back one last time. 'Seriously, why Sunday? Why 3.30 in the afternoon?' 'Because something big is happening all over the globe on Monday at 3pm UK time. That's 11pm Tokyo time.

But we all need deals in place. I too have made a deal, you see, but it's rather like a chain in a property purchase: one link breaks and the whole deal comes tumbling down.

Then we all suffer.' 'All?' 'Universally.' Dara Morgan threw a sideways glance at Caitlin, and she immediately moved to escort Mr Murakami out of the room.

A moment later, the Japanese were gone and Caitlin was back at Dara Morgan's side. He was standing at a massive picture window, a huge panoramic view over West London. He could see the new Wembley Stadium, Centrepoint, the London Eye and other tall London structures.

'Monday,' he smiled, 'and this planet is Madam Delphi's.' Caitlin nodded. 'At last. Revenge is hers.' They took each other's hands and held on tightly, and looked to the computer screens, which appeared to be humming a tune, ever so slightly, causing waveforms on one of the screens to pulsate fractionally in time.

'Welcome back,' they said to her, together.

Donna stood at the end of Brookside Road and took a deep breath. It hadn't been that long since she'd been here last (indeed, for her mum, it was probably slightly less time), but every time she 'came home' there were awkward moments. 'Where have you been?' and 'Are you still hanging around with that awful Doctor person?' and 'Why don't you call?' and 'Have you got a job yet?' Of course, Granddad Wilf knew where she was, she'd told him everything right from the off. But her mum, well, she wasn't someone who'd understand. Wasn't someone who'd think saving Oods, stopping generational wars or ensuring Charlemagne met the Pope actually equated with a 'good' job typing up notes or placing stationery orders.

Taking a deep breath, she walked towards the house that hadn't actually been her home for too long.

After her disastrous wedding and slightly less disastrous trip to Egypt, her parents had moved from their terraced house where Donna had grown up into this new semi. It had been an upheaval, compounded as it was by Donna not having a job and Wilf originally being cross because he thought he'd have to leave his astronomer buddies behind. As it turned out, of course, the allotments were easier to get to from the new house, so he was happy after all.

But Donna's dad hadn't been well for a long time, and in many ways the move had been his idea, his desire to find somewhere new to be, to give him a bit of challenge.

He'd got bored in the old house. He'd built all the cupboards, shelved all the walls, painted all the ceilings he was ever able to do, and he needed something new to keep him active since his illness had made him take early retirement. Doing up the new place to Mum's quite stringent specifications would be exactly the right challenge.

They had been there three months before Dad passed.

Donna and Wilf had taken on the mantle of doing all those odd jobs Dad had been going to do, but they were never quite right, they were never 'how your dad would have done it'. Which wasn't altogether surprising -- Wilf was twenty-odd years older, and Donna had never lifted a paintbrush or hammer in her life before.

God. How shallow was Donna Noble before she met the Doctor again? Before she learned not just to stand on her own two feet but realise that she could. Her family life was a real chicken and egg situation. Had she been useless at home because her parents had always let her be, or did her mum think she was useless because she was? And talking about it, talking about anything, with Sylvia Noble was rarely a positive experience. Donna would love to say that her mum's bitterness and resentment was because of Dad's death, but the truth was Sylvia had always been disappointed in her daughter. She rarely hid it. And Donna never understood why. Had she wanted a son? Had she wanted a high-flying lawyer or company executive daughter who would be rich enough to send her parents off to live in the country in a little sixteenth-century cottage where they could keep goats? Had it got worse since Dad had died? Would it have been better if she had got married to Lance? Should she have told Mum the truth about that day? Like she had Granddad recently? Probably not, because Sylvia didn't like people being open and honest. 'Those bleeding hearts who wear their hearts on their sleeves' was an analogy she'd tortured once, and it summed up her opinion of people actually being honest.

Donna remembered reading a magazine article once about how parents could never truly hope to understand teenaged offspring and their best bet for harmonious living was just to tolerate those three or four nightmare years. But was there a manual for sons and daughters on how to deal with negative parents? It was impossible to actually argue with a mother -- they had an inbuilt 'guilt trip' button to press that forbade you saying all the things you wanted to say to them, whatever they threw at you.

Donna loved her mum, no two ways about that. And she had no doubt that Sylvia Noble loved her daughter.

She just wasn't entirely sure they actually liked each other that much.

'Hullo, Donna,' called Mrs Baldrey from opposite.

'Had a nice trip?' 'Yes thanks,' Donna smiled back. 'How's Seymour?' 'Oh fine. Still complaining about his prostate,' the neighbour groaned.

Donna thought that conversation had gone as far as she wanted it to go, frankly, and speeded up her pace towards home.

A cat sat by a lamppost, warily watching Donna approach, not quite sure if she was friend or foe. Donna made squeaky noises to attract its attention.

It bolted.

Ah well.

Mum's car was outside on the road (you have a drive, Mum, use it) and Donna touched the bonnet as she passed.

Cold. Mum hadn't been out today then. Funny how she'd picked up these little things from travelling with the Doctor to find things out. Like whether a car had been driven. The old Donna would never have thought about that. The old Donna wouldn't have cared.

The old Donna was gone.

Thank God -- her life was a trillion times better these days.

If only she could involve her mum in it, though. That last little piece of the puzzle, that last bit of acceptance from each of them.

'Oh there you are, Lady,' said a familiar voice from behind her. 'I wondered if we'd see you today.' Donna didn't bother turning around. 'Hello, Mum,' she said.

'Oh yes, "Hello, Mum" -- because that's enough isn't it.

One minute the air's choking with exhaust fumes, the next the sky's on fire, and that's it. No idea where my only daughter is. No calls, no texts, not even a message sent to your granddad, so he can shut me up. Nothing.' Donna stopped in the street and turned to face her mother, automatically tugging two of the four shopping bags from her hand to help.

The old Donna wouldn't have considered that either.

'Nice to see you, too,' Donna said. 'Granddad got the kettle on? I could do with a cuppa, loads to tell you.' Sylvia Noble shrugged and stomped off ahead of her daughter. 'You know what today is, don't you,' she called back.

And Donna stopped dead.

Of course she knew what today was. Why the hell did she think she was there? How dare she even ask that question? The front door opened and Sylvia pushed passed Granddad Wilf and went wordlessly into the kitchen.

'Do you know what she just asked me?' Donna hissed at him after kissing his cheek.

Wilf raised his eyes to heaven. 'It's gonna be one of them days, isn't it?' Donna opened her mouth to reply, then stopped.

The old Donna would have gone off on one, there and then. The old Donna would've started a row with her mum, throwing around words like 'attitude' and 'whatever' and 'selfish'.

New Donna didn't.

Because new Donna, frustrating as it was, understood that what Sylvia Noble probably wanted and needed today was a good cry.

But being Sylvia 'I don't wear my heart on my sleeve' Noble meant she'd never do that.

And sadly it was going to be new Donna's job today to ensure she did, before bottling it up caused her mum more damage than it already had.

The Doctor was striding down Chiswick High Road, glancing into various shops where people were staring at the new laptop demonstrations. 'It's just a computer,' he muttered. 'Why so much interest?' 'They're already out of date,' said a young voice beside him. 'The M-TEK -- that's the future.' The Doctor looked over, then down. The speaker barely reached knee height. It was a little boy. The Doctor had seen him before somewhere -- then running towards him, he saw Lukas Carnes, and realised this was the little brother he'd been carrying.
