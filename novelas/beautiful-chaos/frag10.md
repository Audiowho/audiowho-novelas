Now Melville was alert and curious. Miss Oladini, too, despite her lack of interest in astronomy, because she'd been a mathematics student (hence her ending up here) and she calculated the odds of one Chaos Body suddenly forming a new constellation with four pre-existing stars all on the same night to be… well, bigger odds than there were numerical spaces on her calculator.

Melville patched through the latest photos onto the big screen that dominated one wall of his office. It was indeed a big screen, and state-of-the-art technology that other observatories and radio telescopes around the UK would have donated a lot of right arms for. All Melville had to do was trace an invisible line from his laptop screen to the big screen on the wall and images and words flowed from one to the other like something out of a sci-fi movie.

Melville was proud of the software, but hadn't a clue how it worked. He just knew it did and it meant he could move images around on the wall-sized screen without leaving his chair. Which he was doing now.

First he centred his own photo of the Chaos Star. Then he overlayed Clemenstry's. Then Griffin's, Tycho's and finally Colossus's.

'Professor…?' 'I know.' 'But that's…' 'I know.' 'I mean, how…' 'I don't know.' 'I've never seen anything like it.' 'I know.' Melville grabbed a phone on his desk. It was red. As he started punching in numbers, he glanced up at Miss Oladini. 'Have you signed the OSA, Miss Oladini?' She frowned. 'Do what?' 'The Official Secrets Act. Did they make you sign it when you got your work placement forms for this place at the agency?' Miss Oladini thought for a moment. Melville was scaring her with the question. Normally, he was a nice old guy, bit dotty, bit rambling, smoked his pipe too often. But now he was suddenly alert and officious, stern and all sense of 'eccentric' gone.

And Miss Oladini realised that the silly, fussy, dotty old man was an act. Underneath it all, Professor Melville was sharp as a whistle. Maybe he really had been a pop singer.

'Well?' She nodded. She had signed something that had the word 'official' in it, she remembered that. Frankly she hadn't taken much notice of it when Mrs Lovelace at the agency had got her to sign. All the temps signed bits of paper for health and safety, insurance waivers that sort of thing, when they got their placements. One extra hadn't meant much at the time.

Now it seemed big and scary.

'Why?' 'Because without your signature on the bottom of that form, what I'm about to do and what you're about to hear would have us both in jail for the rest of our lives if you haven't.' And Miss Oladini thought hard. Her brain was good with numbers. 'Form KD62344,' she said suddenly. 'I signed it twice and initialled a box, bottom left.' Melville winked. 'Thank you.' He punched a final number on the phone. 'Aubrey Fairchild, please. This is the Copernicus Array, Code 18. My name is Melville.' Miss Oladini looked back at the assembled collage of images. The Chaos Body plus the other stars on display meant nothing individually. But now that Melville had put them together, they formed a picture. And not just some abstract nonsense that people saw as a couple of fish, or a plough or a rollercoaster.

This was very clearly, distinctly and sharply a face. A face with a mouth twisted into a laugh.

Miss Oladini shivered because that laugh wasn't a happy laugh. It was pure malevolence.

'Prime Minister? Melville, Administrative Professor at the Copernicus Array. I'm sending you a Code 18 image.' There was a pause. 'Yes, sir. No, sir, the images have only been combined here, it's still a UK threat but give it a few hours…' Professor Melville looked across at Miss Oladini. 'No, sir, just myself and my assistant. We'll stay put until we hear from your people, Prime Minister. No, absolutely, total lockdown, no communications in or out of the Copernicus Array under any circumstances. Goodnight, sir.' Professor Melville replaced the phone.

'That was really the Prime Minister?' Miss Oladini asked.

Melville nodded. 'I'm sorry, my dear, but I think we're in for a long night here. Could you check where we are regarding tea and milk?' Miss Oladini started to leave the room, then turned back to see Melville take a mobile phone from his jacket pocket. She hadn't even known he had a mobile phone.

'Professor? Didn't you just promise Mr Fairchild that we'd have no communications?' He smiled. 'That's why I need you to check on the tea.

If you are not in the room, you can't be held responsible when I break that promise, commit treason and quite probably professional suicide. Now, for your sake, off you go.' Confused, Miss Oladini left the office. But she waited just outside the door, to see if she could hear who he was calling.

She heard the tell-tale electronic beeps of the keypad then, after what must have been quite a few rings, he spoke. 'Good evening, my name is Professor Melville.

May I speak with the Doctor, please?' The cab was about halfway down Prince Albert Drive, between Vauxhall and Chiswick, doing nearly 20 because of the speed humps.

In the back of the cab, Donna took out her ringing phone and stared at the number, but didn't recognise it.

With a shrug, she pressed accept. 'Hallo?' She listened and then passed it over to the Doctor.

He smiled. 'I had the TARDIS routed to your number.

Should've told you. Sorry.' 'How did you cope before mobiles?' she sighed. 'A Professor Melville, apparently.' The Doctor grinned. 'And there's another coincidence – it's one of those nights, isn't it,' he said before speaking into the phone. 'Ahab! What can I do for the Copernicus Array tonight? As if I can't guess. Does it involve the phrase Chaos Body?' Miss Oladini was having her fill of surprising things tonight. First the stars making pictures. Then dotty old Professor Melville having hotlines to the Prime Minister.

Then discovering that the milk in the kitchenette hadn't gone off for once. Oh, and then her boyfriend phoning at nearly midnight.

'Spencer? What do you want?' 'Don't tell me you haven't used that bloody great telescope to look at the sky?' Miss Oladini crossed to the kitchen door, the one that led outside, not into the corridor and peeked out into the cold night air, not really thinking she'd see anything with the naked eye.

So she was quite surprised when she could.

'Is it some kind of firework display?' Spencer asked.

She wondered what to say. Ten minutes earlier, the skies had been clear and the laughing face could only be seen in photographs. Now it was very visible across the heavens, and if her daft old boyfriend had spotted it – and not written it off as a lager-fuelled trip – then something needed to be done. She remembered the Official Secrets Act and told Spencer that yes, it was probably just something being projected from the roof of one of the cinemas down Dagenham way. 'A movie promotional thing,' she said, adding 'and they phoned and warned us about it yesterday,' which was an awful lie, but seemed to make Spencer happy.

After he'd rung off, it crossed her mind that the rest of Britain might not be quite so ready to believe her story – not least because she couldn't phone each person individually and tell them.

Maybe the Prime Minister would. Or Patrick Moore.

'How's the tea coming?' Miss Oladini turned to see Melville in the doorway, a big smile on his face. She mentioned that the face from the photo was now visible in the sky, and Melville wandered over to the window and peered through.

'Not to worry,' he said. 'An expert's looking into it.' 'From Downing Street?' 'Oh no. Someone far better equipped than anyone there.' He glanced out of the window. 'Horrible-looking thing, isn't it?' he said, as the kettle began to boil again.

'Milk no sugar wasn't it, Miss Oladini?' She nodded mutely.

'I'm not worried now,' he added. 'The Doctor will sort it all out.' There was a flash of lights from outside, and they heard a couple of cars pull up in the staff car park.

'That was quick,' Melville muttered, frowning slightly.

'Downing Street or your Doctor friend?' she asked, trying not to sound nervous. 'Or maybe someone else from round here, concerned by the thing in the sky?' But Melville wasn't listening, really. He was watching to see who was in the cars.

The headlights were left full on, beaming in through the kitchenette window, so they couldn't see who got out of the car, just heard the sounds of doors opening and slamming.

Miss Oladini shivered. This felt… wrong.

Melville presumably agreed, because he suddenly dashed for the outside door, as if to bolt it. He was too late. Someone shoved the door open.

Melville stood in front of Miss Oladini, chivalrously protecting her from whoever the newcomers were.

There were… well, a lot of them, different ages, not looking especially… government-ish. Or terribly threatening.

But there was something about them, Miss Oladini thought, something about the way they looked around the kitchenette, their heads moving unnaturally as if they were seeing the inside of a kitchen for the first time.

An old, fat man was at the front, a middle-aged man behind him. Behind them were an old woman and a trio of student-types, two men and a woman.

'Where are the others?' the first old man asked in an American accent.

Professor Melville cleared his throat. 'This is private property. This is the Copernicus Array. You can't just turn up at gone midnight and—' The young student woman pushed past the others, looking at Melville as if she couldn't quite understand why he was standing there. 'You… work here?' she said.

English, that one.

He nodded. 'I am in charge of the radio telescope, and this evening I am in charge of the whole project. I should warn you that you have tripped an alarm and the police will be here in minutes.' Another student spoke. His voice sounded European, Spanish or maybe Italian. 'I cannot detect any such alarm system. The human is lying.' Human? What a strange expression.

But Professor Melville seemed unfazed by the choice of words, indeed, he almost relished them. 'What planet do you represent? Are you connected with that Chaos constellation?' The large American spoke again. 'You may be of use to us.' Without missing a beat, Melville pointed to Miss Oladini. 'And my assistant. If you need my help, you'll need hers, too. Everything at Copernicus requires two experienced operators.' Was he mad, Miss Oladini wondered.

'She's a highly qualified physicist and is an expert in the field of the cosmic sciences.' Definitely mad.

'Something is wrong here,' said the older woman, also an American, walking forward. Without warning, she reached out and touched Professor Melville's shoulder. At first Miss Oladini assumed they'd both been electrocuted as a fierce purplish spark shot between them, and Melville staggered slightly, gasping in pain.

'Professor?' Miss Oladini found her voice, but immediately regretted it.

Melville turned to look at her and, for a second, she could still see vestiges of that purple light in his eyes. 'All right, I lied. She's my temporary assistant,' Melville said breathlessly. 'She has no understanding of the Copernicus Array and is harmless.' 'We can absorb her.' 'Let her go, please…' Melville collapsed, and the three students stepped over him as they headed towards her.

Miss Oladini did the one thing no amount of chats with Mrs Lovelace in Brentwood, or Health and Safety forms or 100 words per minute could have prepared her for. She spun round and ran for her life, clattering out of the kitchenette and back into the heart of the corridors and offices of the Copernicus Array. Somehow she knew she was running for her life.

The cab was driving along past the Earls Court Exhibition Centre when the Doctor tapped on the glass and asked the driver, 'Can you pull over for just one minute, please.' 'Well?' Donna asked the Doctor, as the cab slowed down.

'Ummm, well… Actually you need to head home, because I'm going to ask this nice man to drive me somewhere else.' 'Chiswick High Road?' The Doctor frowned, then remembered where the TARDIS was parked. 'No. No actually, bit further than that.' Donna realised. 'You're going to see matey boy on the phone, at that telescope place. Copper Knickers or whatever it was called.' 'Where to then, mate?' the exasperated taxi driver asked.

'Essex. Just off the A127.' The driver snorted. 'At this time of night? I live in Bounds Green. I told you I was off home.' 'Then it won't take you as long to get home from there, will it “mate”,' Donna snapped. 'How much will it cost? Cos I guarantee the Doctor's not got much cash on him.

And as I already subbed Granddad tonight, I might as well do him too.' 'One hundred.' 'OK,' the Doctor said.

'OK?' squawked Donna. 'How is a hundred quid “OK”?' The Doctor ignored her and leaned towards the driver.

'But I need to get there a bit quick.' 'Hundred and twenty, then.' 'Whatever,' the Doctor sighed. 'Donna, I'll see you tomorrow. You can get another cab home from here, yes? Oh, and Donna?' 'Yes?' 'You got that hundred and twenty pounds on you?' Donna looked like she was going to clobber him, then spoke to the driver. 'Essex,' she snapped. 'Via a cashpoint, please.' The Doctor raised an eyebrow. 'Donna?' 'Sunshine,' Donna grinned. 'If I'm giving you a hundred plus to go to a snazzy radio telescope, I'm coming along for the ride.' The Doctor beamed. 'Hoped you'd say that.' And the taxi drove up towards Kensington as the Doctor and Donna made plans.

Wilf and Netty were saying their farewells, apologising for bringing the night to a premature end.

'We'll do this again soon,' Ariadne Holt told them.

'And have the actual presentation.' 'I'm so sorry to have to dash off,' Wilf lied, 'but something has come up. I need to see Miss Goodhart home. Please forgive me.' 'Nothing to forgive,' Crossland said, slapping his back.

'Any excuse for a dinner party, eh? Next week's meeting?' On his face, Wilf had a fixed smile, but his eyes told a different story. 'I'd really enjoy that,' he said.

Netty leaned in and whispered to him. 'They'll be all right. The Doctor knows what he's doing.' Wilf smiled at her, trying to look more reassured than he actually felt.

He wondered if he should have gone with them.

And he wondered more what Sylvia was going to say when he turned up just after midnight without them.

The Copernicus Array was in darkness when the cab pulled up in the public car park. Donna paid the grumpy driver, who headed Londonwards as quickly as possible.

'Can I just ask how we get home from here?' she hissed to the Doctor as they snuck about in the darkness. 'It's a long way back.' 'Walk?' Donna poked his shoulder, and as he looked at her, she motioned downwards, implying he should look at her clothing.

'You look lovely,' he smiled, putting his brainy specs on.

'Well thank you, Casanova, but that wasn't my point. I am dolled up to the eyeballs in a party frock that isn't designed to be worn on a forty-mile trek across England.' She sighed. 'I had to borrow this, you know. Veena's not going to forgive me if it gets damaged. And if she doesn't forgive me, God knows what she'll do to you when I tell her who it was that made me walk all that way in it.' 'Don't tell her, then.' Donna gave up and tried a new tack. 'OK, so why are we here and why are the lights off? Surely, if it's an observatory and it's night time, this place should be at the height of its working day?' 'Good point, well observed. And that's why we're crawling around in the car park and bushes and not marching up to the front door.' 'But I thought your mate worked here.' 'He does.' 'So why aren't we marching up to the front door and saying, “Hello, mate of the Doctor's, you called, we came”?' The Doctor was staring at a car parked across the lawn in the staff car park. 'What's wrong with that car?' Donna peered through the gloom. 'They don't know how to park straight?' 'And?' 'They'll ruin the grass?' 'And?' 'And… the lights are dying?' 'That's the one.' 'So?' The Doctor grinned. 'Think about it. How old does that car look?' 'New. So it should've beeped to tell them they'd left their lights on. So they ignored it. And if it's that new, the thingy wotsit that makes the lights work shouldn't lose power so soon. Dad left the lights on overnight a couple of years ago and they were still on the next morning and the car was fine. And his car was ancient.' The Doctor walked towards the car, sonic screwdriver in hand, and scanned the vehicle. 'Huge energy drain, locally,' he muttered.

Donna tapped his arm. 'Hey, you seen that?' The Doctor followed her view. Up in the sky was a grinning face made of stars. 'City glow must've hidden that on the drive out here,' he said quietly.

'Fireworks?' 'Let's hope most people think so,' he replied.
