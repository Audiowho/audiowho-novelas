'No, no, it's time Lady Muck over there had a few home truths.' Sylvia leaned forward, jabbing at the air with her finger. 'Your grandfather and I are worried sick, you know that? You up and leave with barely a word, you turn up once in a blue moon when it suits you and you're off again. I don't know whether you're alive or dead. I don't know if each time the phone rings it's you telling me you're in Timbuktu, or there's a ring on the doorbell and it'll be the police saying they've found you washed up in the Thames. A letter arrives for you and I put it on the mantelpiece, hoping that somehow that means you'll come home sooner. But after a couple of weeks, I just chuck it on your bed because it doesn't work. It doesn't bring you home. Ever since you met that Doctor bloke, you've become a different person.' Donna stared at her mum in mute shock. Where had all this come from. 'Why the hell would you assume I'm dead? That's mad.' 'It's not mad, it's not unreasonable. It's what I think.

Every day I don't hear from you, I think it more. Maybe if you were a mother, maybe if you'd got kids, stupid, selfish, unthinking kids, you'd understand.' Sylvia was shaking now.

Donna was horrified. She'd somehow, without meaning to, without quite knowing why, she'd made her mum cry! For all the wrong reasons! Like there were right ones… You're not supposed to make your mum cry… 'I'm not gonna die, Mum! No policeman's gonna ring the doorbell and say I'm dead.' 'Why not?' Sylvia was almost screaming now, not in an angry way, but tears were rolling down her cheeks -- no, they were actually throwing themselves down her face, like wet lemmings. 'Why not? It's what happened when your dad died!' The sudden silence was gut-wrenchingly terrible.

Then Donna was across the room, hugging her sobbing mother, holding her, squeezing her, mumbling apologies and soothing words, telling her that it was all right, that she was there.

But one thought ran through her mind. Tomorrow, she'd be gone again. With the Doctor. Because that's what she wanted.

But did she have the right to? Had she really earned the right to go off again if this was what her mum thought? All those times she and Sylvia had fought, argued, yelled. As a teenager (and frankly, most of her spoilt twenties), Donna had just put it down to 'that's my mum'.

But Donna wasn't that person now, and she could see that her widowed mum, one year on, needed her daughter more than ever before.

And Donna was crying too now.

Crying for her mum's pain, her dad's loss, remembering that knock on the door. The policeman standing there.

'He was supposed to die here, in my arms, with his family,' Sylvia was saying. 'Not in a bloody filling station.

Alone.' At which point, with timing for which both the words 'impeccable' and 'inconvenient' were invented, the doorbell rang.

Wordlessly, Wilf went to answer it, and Donna heard him say 'Ah, not a good time.' Donna knew, without hearing the response, exactly who was on the doorstep.

And so did Sylvia.

She looked with red, teary eyes at her daughter.

And, for the first time that Donna could remember, Sylvia Noble stroked Donna's face, a soft caress of pure maternal love. 'I'll put the kettle on.' Then she called, 'Come in, Doctor.' A moment later, the Doctor's face popped round the sitting room door, brainy specs in place, hair madder than normal.

'Hullo,' he said to all of them. 'Do you know the Carnes family by any chance? I think they've got aliens in the family.' The tourist trade in Moscatelli was mainly based around olive groves, orangeries, a nice vineyard and the annual motorcycle race that started thirteen miles away in Florence and ended up the other side of the mountains in this small but oft-visited little town.

The people who lived in Moscatelli were mostly Italians who had been there for thirty or so generations.

Everyone knew everyone and it was friendly, welcoming and cheerful.

It was also, in the middle of May, the recipient of stunningly good weather, and Jayne Greene thought it brought out the best in the locals. Not least of which was that Tonio was spending most of the day during the dig wearing nothing but a pair of tight denim cut-offs that left very little to the imagination (and Jayne could imagine quite a lot). The Professor had employed Tonio and his family to help them set up the dig a week or so back.

Jayne and her two fellow students, Sean and Ben, had agreed to accompany the Professor there for the summer because it would give them really good marks in the end- of-course assessments, it'd be an adventure to travel to a nice part of Italy and it was a great way to get a tan.

'Got it!' Sean yelled excitedly.

'How much?' asked Ben, sifting soil a couple of feet away from where the laptop was set up by the food tent.

'Seventy-eight euro.' 'Sixty-something quid. Not bad.' Ben nodded. 'Well done.' 'I bloody love eBay,' Sean smiled at Jayne. 'Yaay me!' 'Was it the Egyptian pot?' Sean looked at her and shook his head, slowly.

'Not the Iron Age spade?' More head shaking.

Jayne dropped her own tools and wandered over to the laptop and looked at what Sean had just committed sixty pounds to.

'That?' 'That.' 'It's a toy.' 'Course it's a toy,' Ben yelled as Tonio poured some more earth into his sieve. 'What else does Sean ever buy off eBay?' Jayne couldn't understand it. 'You mean, you spent all that money, and seven days' frustrated watching the auction, for a mass-produced toy?' 'Action figure,' Sean corrected her. 'Limited edition.

Only five hundred produced, and that was eight years ago.

It's a variant paint job, y'see, she's wearing her red Dark Period costume instead of the traditional green one.' Jayne just looked at Sean. 'You are an adult. You are a grown man getting excited about a plastic toy. A figure for kids. A…' 'Don't say "dolly",' Ben muttered to himself.

'… a dolly?' Sean slammed the laptop shut. 'My money, my choice.

You get excited about Roman pins and earthenware.' 'So do you!' 'Yeah, cos that's a job. That's what I do here and at uni.

But in my spare time, I have other hobbies. I have…' 'Don't say "a life",' Ben muttered to himself again.

'… a life,' Sean finished. 'You should try getting one before you criticise everyone else.' Jayne stared at Sean, then across at Ben, who made sure he caught no one's eye and started to run his finger pointlessly through the dirt, in an effort to pretend he had something to distract him.

The tension was broken by little Professor Rossi, stumbling back around the tents after a trip to the town for some milk and teabags.

'Now, now, I could hear you up on the main road.

What's going on?' 'Nothing,' Sean grunted. 'Sorry Prof.' Rossi shook his head, scratching the scar that created a small slash across his cheek. At uni, everyone joked it was a duelling scar he'd got fighting for a woman he loved, but one day someone discovered the truth -- that ten years earlier he'd been cut in the car accident that had killed his wife. Everyone lost interest in imagining romantic things about the scar after that.

'What am I going to do with you three? I bring you out here from university for the mid-term break, to visit the family home, and to give you all the chance to improve your frankly dodgy archaeology marks. And all you do is play with the broadband, flirt with poor Tonio there and embarrass him, or drink too much orange wine. You are here to work, you know. Being sociable is a pleasant side effect but not essential. What is essential, however, is teamwork. Sean and Jayne, I don't care if you can't get on, but you will work together. Jayne and Ben, I don't care if you want to fight over Tonio's attention, you will work together. Sean and Ben I don't care if you can drink one another under the table at night, provided you turn up fresh and able the next day. Is all that understood? I am not your parents but I am the man who will mark your end-of-term papers, and you would do well to remember that keeping me sweet is a positive move.' Rossi put some cartons of milk on the table next to the laptop. 'So, whose turn is it to make tea?' Sean volunteered as Rossi scooped up the laptop.

'Hopefully the Bursar has forwarded some more funds to us so we can try and trace those tunnels through the hills across to the lake.' 'How far do your family go back here, Professor?' Jayne asked.

Rossi shrugged. 'I'm in the process of finding that out at the library. Certainly my paternal great-grandparents were the ones who moved to Ipswich, but I suspect their roots are here right back to the fifteenth century.' Ben headed over with his sieve. 'So we are looking for more than fifteenth-century Italian pots and pans then? I said so! Come on, Professor, what's the big secret?' 'Ah,' Rossi grinned. 'Well, you see, somewhere in this area an entire Dukedom vanished. A whole town with a castle and everything was based around here, or in the hills or somewhere in the vicinity of that lake beyond the orange groves. I'm trying to find its borders.' 'How do we know?' Sean asked as the kettle boiled.

'It's in the records in the library,' Tonio said in good but heavily accented English.

Jayne and Ben stared at Tonio in mute shock -- and slight horror.

He grinned. 'Oh right, you both thought I didn't understand English,' he laughed, a deep bellowing laugh.

So did Professor Rossi. 'Now that,' he said, 'is funny.

Did neither of you realise?' Dumbly, they both shook their heads as Sean busied himself with the tea, determined not to catch their eyes.

'But that means…' Jayne started.

'Everything we've said…' added Ben.

'About you…' Jayne again.

'You… you heard… Oh God… kill me now…' Ben put his sieve down and sat hard on the ground.

Tonio tousled Ben's dark hair and winked at him, before throwing a look to Jayne. 'Sorry, you lose.' 'Course I do,' Jayne said. 'When does life ever go Jayne Greene's way?' The laptop bleeped and, leaving the students to sort out the tea and Tonio's confession, Professor Rossi accessed his emails in response. Nothing from the Bursar, but there was one message: From: Madam Delphi To: Rossi@Tarminsteruni.ac.uk Subject: SAN MARTINO Professor Rossi My congratulations, you have rediscovered your heritage, and you are indeed in San Martino, just as you hoped. Click on this link to be taken to my site for more information about this delightful Italianate kingdom and its secrets.

The Professor was about to call the students over, but thought it would be better to check that this wasn't a hoax.

(Although how did anyone know they were searching for San Martino? He hadn't even told the students the name of the kingdom). So he clicked the hotlink.

Instead of a new webpage, the screen was instantly filled with a pulsating ball of bright white light, highlighted with lilac edges and spirals.

Instinctively he let his hand reach forward to touch the screen… to go into the screen, to go through the screen… as if his right hand was being consumed by the transfixing ball of energy.

Then he withdrew his hand, and looked at it.

Crackling around the fingertips were the vestiges of purple pulses of energy, like tiny flickers of raw electrical power. He turned his hand over, studying the little pulses until they seemed to vanish for good, absorbed into his skin. He rubbed his fingers together, and then looked back at the screen. It just displayed Sean's eBay victory again.

The Professor stood up and turned to face his students and held his arms out, hands flat. 'We've done it,' he breathed.

Instantly distracted from their own petty concerns, the four young people walked over, Jayne and Sean taking an offered hand each, excitedly returning the gesture, if unsure what they were celebrating.

After a second, they wordlessly released the Professor's hands, and Rossi then grabbed Ben and Tonio's hands. And they in turn took Sean and Jayne's, the five now forming a circle.

In unison, they all raised their linked hands into the air, purple electricity building and crackling around them.

The others followed the direction of his gaze as the Professor looked up into the sky.

'Welcome back,' he said quietly.

Dinner was subdued in the Noble household.

Sylvia silently put food on plates. Donna silently passed the plates from the work surface to the dining table. Wilf silently poured water into tumblers -- three matching ones from a petrol station, and a larger one with Donald Duck on it. The Doctor had that.

The Doctor sat there, uncomfortable with domesticity at the best of times, utterly ill at ease right now.

'Dubai?' Sylvia said, suddenly sitting up.

The Doctor shot a look at Donna -- what was he supposed to say? 'With the horses,' Wilf helpfully prodded.

'Horses?' The Doctor was like a rabbit caught in headlights. 'Horses. Yes, marvellous things.' 'The Sheikh of Dubai put us up for a couple of weeks,' Donna interjected. ' Didn't he?' Sylvia started eating. Something cheese-y and macaroni-y the Doctor had guessed, but he wasn't quite sure. Something that looked like this had once tried to bite off his toes on the coast of Kal-Durunt in the Keripedes Cluster.

He gently eased his fork into it.

'I'm sorry it's not as posh as what you get in Dubai, with horses and sheikhs,' Sylvia said. 'But I had no notice from either of you that you were coming.' 'Oh, well, we couldn't have Donna missing today,' the Doctor said brightly. Too brightly. Wrong occasion for Tigger-Doctor, better to be Eeyore-Doctor tonight.

'I thought the Emirates were run by emirs, not sheikhs,' Sylvia said, pouring herself more water. 'But what do I know? I just sit here every day, waiting for people to turn up out of the blue, expecting to be fed.' The Doctor just threw a look at Donna that he thought said 'help' but Donna clearly took to mean 'no, it's OK, ignore me, oh and right now would be the time to pick a really good fight with your mum'.

So Donna did.

'What is your problem, Mum? Most people would kill to have family around them.' Wilf tried to intervene, but Donna was going off on one now.

'I mean, Mooky goes away for two weeks, her parents throw a bloody party to celebrate her return. And all she's done is go shopping in Glasgow. I get to see the gala- well, to see the world, things I never thought I'd get the chance to do, and all I get is moans.' Sylvia didn't look up from her food. 'Yeah, but they probably knew where Mooky was. All I know is when your granddad there bothers to say he had a postcard. And I'm never allowed to read them, oh no.' Donna was going to chastise Wilf for that when she remembered that said postcards were usually sent from another star system entirely.

'OK, Mum, I'll start sending you postcards too.

Promise.' 'Oh it's not just that,' Sylvia said. 'It's the whole life I have. Your dad's gone, you've gone, and I'm stuck here as nursemaid for your granddad's bit on the side.' Donna opened her mouth to speak, then shut it again.

Then, as that comment sank in, her mouth opened again, but still no sound came out.

'Bit on the side?' the Doctor asked Wilf.

Wilf glowered at Sylvia. 'She's a friend,' he said. 'I'm not gonna marry her.' 'I should hope not,' Sylvia said. 'Mum would turn in her grave.' 'Ahhh, so that's what it's all about,' Wilf sighed. 'You think Eileen wouldn't approve. You think somehow me seeing a poor, sick old lady would make Eileen sad. Well, you're wrong. She was your mother, but she was my wife.

I knew her better than that.' The Doctor remembered why he didn't 'do' families.

'Lovely macaroni cheese, Mrs Noble,' he said, stuffing his mouth. 'Mmmmm…' 'It's mushroom raclette,' she snapped.

'Not macaroni?' 'Mushroom.' 'It's… great… very cheesy. And…' 'So, who is this lady, Gramps?' Donna asked.

Wilf smiled. 'She's a lady astronomer I know, from Greenwich. Helps out at the observatory there, has done for years. But about three years ago she was… well, she fell ill and had to stop working. We chatted on the phone a couple of times, met up, had dinner. You'd think I'd started dating a teenage married pregnant cousin the way Sylvia goes on about her.' The Doctor was looking at Sylvia Noble, however.

Spotting what made her flush angrily when Wilf spoke. It had been the word 'ill'.

He looked back at the old paratrooper. 'Why'd she give up at the Observatory then?' 'Ask her yourself,' Sylvia said. 'She'll be here any minute. Even on Geoff's day, my daughter brings you round, and he brings her round.' And Sylvia was up and out of the kitchen.

Donna sighed and went after her mum. Wilf made to follow, but the Doctor caught his arm.

'I'm no expert, Wilfred, but I reckon best leave the ladies to it.' Wilf nodded.

'And your friend?' 'Netty. Henrietta Goodhart.' He smiled. 'Most appropriate name I think she could have. But she was diagnosed with… She has Alzheimer's, Doctor. And it's not getting any better.' 'It wouldn't,' the Doctor said quietly, just as the doorbell rang. 'That her?' Wilf nodded and went to let her in.
