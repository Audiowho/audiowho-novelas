A moment later and the Doctor was grinning at a vision of eccentricity, charm and humour that only certain English women of a particular age and bearing could carry off.

She was dressed from head to foot in brown -- knee- length corduroy skirt, tan blouse, chocolate-coloured jacket -- and carried a tan handbag. On her head was an amazing hat with at least half a dozen brown feathers of different shapes and sizes. Wilf was removing her long dark overcoat, and Netty offered her hand to the Doctor before Wilf had got the coat off her, meaning one sleeve, the hand-shaking sleeve, was still on.

'Doctor, how marvellous to meet you. Hooray and huzzah, it's a real pleasure.' 'Mrs Goodhart.' 'Miss, please. Better still, just Netty. Never been married and, despite what Wilfred's daughter believes, have no intention to ever be married.' Wilf finally got the coat off her, and Netty slid neatly into a chair, grabbing a glass of water in an obviously well-rehearsed manoeuvre.

'I never married,' she went on. 'Seemed such an alarming waste of time. I live in Greenwich you know, bit of a trek out here, but my local cab firm, they know me and my little ways, so it's never a problem if I forget to have money. Or where I'm going.' The Doctor had taken to this gregarious lady instantly.

'You can't beat a reliable taxi firm, Netty,' he said, managing to get a sentence in before she blithely carried on.

'Are they rowing yet? It's all they ever do. And it's about me. I was so ashamed to start with, now I just treat it as a ritual, and in ten minutes Sylvia's back to her normal charming self, full of tea and crackers.' The Doctor smiled. 'Sylvia Noble? Charming? Words not often in the same sentence.' The look he got from Netty showed him how he'd misjudged the situation between the two women.

'Oh, don't disappoint me, Doctor. Not after all I've been told about you. That woman out there is a saint.

She's just lost her husband, she's got a daughter you drag halfway to God knows where on a whim, and has to tolerate that marvellous Wilfred, who can be just as stubborn and cantankerous as her. More so in fact. I like her a lot. Besides which, and I know she complains, but that's just her way of letting off steam, she's bloody terrific with my… you know…' Netty tapped the side of her head. 'My condition. Bless her, last weekend she drove Wilf all the way to Charlton. Apparently I was found in someone's back garden, trying to convince them I used to live there when I was six!' 'And did you?' 'Good gracious, no. I was brought up in Hampshire.' She dived into her handbag and brought out an A5-sized red notebook and showed it to him. 'My life,' she said simply. 'So I can remember things.' The Doctor looked her straight in the eye and saw, briefly, a very scared but very proud old lady. And he liked her even more than before.

'Without that book, without the likes of Sylvia Noble, I'm nothing. I'd left my bag in a shop on Greenwich High Street, so I'm in this garden, unable to know who I am, where I'm from. Sylvia found a receipt in my pocket, found the shop, got my bag back where I'd left it, sorted it all out with the police. She wants to put me in a home, you know. The brochures are in that drawer next to the cooker.' 'Really?' 'Yes. Wilf won't hear of it. Says he'll have me move in here first. Daft old fool, as if I'm going to go from one house I can barely cope with to another. But a lovely nursing home, where I'll be looked after? How marvellous is that?' The kitchen door opened. Donna and Sylvia trooped in, and Donna immediately introduced herself.

As Sylvia put the kettle on, the Doctor crossed and stood behind her. 'Does Wilf know all you do for his friend?' 'Does Donna know you're poking your nose into her family's business?' Sylvia responded.

'I'm not your enemy, Mrs Noble,' the Doctor said.

Sylvia turned and smiled at him. The most insincere smile possible. 'For my daughter's sake, Doctor, I tolerate you in this house. But that's all. For my dad's sake, I'll do the best I can for Netty Goodhart. I don't think I'm a selfish woman, Doctor. I've worked hard, I built a life, I never had much money, and I tried to give Donna a decent life. But then one day, I lost my husband. My rock. And since then I've tried to do what both of us did, but with a daughter who one minute won't get a job, the next can afford to be in a different hemisphere, but can't afford a stamp, and an old dad who seems to have decided it's time to replace my mum once and for all.' 'Are you sure you're not worried he's replacing you? I imagine he let your mum go a long time ago.' The silence that followed the slap around the face he received seemed to go on for a few hours, but was probably only a few seconds.

'I didn't mean it like that…' the Doctor started. 'I genuinely wondered—' Sylvia ignored him. 'Dad,' she said. 'Why don't you take the Doctor up to the allotment, eh? Donna and I can catch up with Netty while you two have an hour or… a few hours up there, yes?' Wilf took the hint and was all but dragging the Doctor out of the kitchen as the women watched.

The last thing the Doctor heard was 'Tea, everyone' from Sylvia, before Wilf had thrust them both out into the night air.

'Allotment. This way,' the old man said.

Babis Takis hoiked the largest bale of hay onto the back of the station wagon and stopped to rest. He wasn't getting any younger, and this was really Nikos's job.

But Nikos wasn't here, he was probably around the back of the farm, messing with that Spiros girl. Typical.

There was work to be done -- they had to get this consignment over to Faliraki, where so much building work was still going on. Hotels, apartments, shopping malls, everything the whole Dodecanese would benefit from because of the continued tourism it would bring.

Babis yelled out Nikos's name a couple of times as he hauled up more bales of hay. He glanced at his watch. It would take an hour or so to drive across the island to the Petaloudes, where they would collect Kris, before going on to Lindos and along the coast to Faliraki. They'd drop off the hay at the depot, then it was off to Erik's Taverna for the night.

Still no sign of Nikos.

With a sigh, Babis walked away from the station wagon. 'I am an old man, Nikos,' he called out. 'I fought in the war, you know, so people like you could be independent and have your luxuries. Just once, it'd be nice if you could pull your weight.' He had reached the rear of the farm, when he heard a noise from inside one of the stables -- a short female gasp of surprise, almost fear. Certainly alarm.

Babis was inside the stable in a second.

Nikos was on the ground, holding his head in his hands, silent but clearly dazed.

Standing over him, a shovel in her hands was a pretty young girl, who Babis recognised as Katarina Spiros.

'You all right, girl?' Babis asked, reaching for the shovel.

Katarina swung around to face Nikos's grandfather, and he realised how scared she looked. 'What happened?' Babis asked.

He was surprised when Katarina explained. 'He took a call…' She was pointing at Nikos Takis, who was now beginning to stand up, abandoning the cell phone on the ground by his foot. He looked at his grandfather, causing Babis to take an involuntary step back.

Babis Takis had fought in the latter days of the war as a youth, kicking the Nazis out of Crete and keeping Greece for the Greeks. He had faced the wrath and pain of his parents, who had so hated and eventually rejected him for falling in love, marrying and having children with one of the hated Italians who had occupied the Greek Islands for seven hundred years before being sent packing after the war. He had done some time in prison for a barroom brawl in Diagoras, and he had once had to face the embittered son of a German he'd tied a live grenade to back in 1944.

But nothing had ever scared him as much as the look his grandson gave him right now.

Nikos wasn't there any more. That carefree, funny, clever grandson he had nurtured after his father's death was just not there.

Babis didn't know how he knew that. He didn't know how it had happened. But he'd never been so sure of anything in his life.

He was still sure of this when a flash of purple fire, hotter than the heart of a sun, extinguished his existence in less time than it took Katarina Spiros to draw breath to scream.

A second later, a handful of ashes dropped to the ground where the young girl had stood.

And Nikos Takis threw his arms towards the sky, purple electricity buzzing around his fingertips, as he threw back his head.

'Welcome back,' he yelled triumphantly.

Donnie and Portia were on their honeymoon. It was Donnie's first, Portia's second, but both were enjoying themselves enormously.

Donnie's son had been his best man. His grandson had been pageboy. Portia's granddaughter had been the flower-girl. They'd had two ceremonies, a full-on Jewish one and a simpler Christian one to reflect both their chosen faiths. Portia had always stayed in the Jewish faith, whereas Donnie's family had pretty much abandoned it within weeks of arriving at Ellis Island a century and a bit earlier.

They had overcome the odds -- a cancer scare for Donnie, some severe frowning by Portia's more traditional relatives and the death of their 8-year-old cat, Mr Smokey, a week before the ceremonies. After knowing each other for fifteen years, courting for the last six, they were finally together for ever.

And here they were, in Donnie's jeep, having bombed along the 8, passing through Danbury, before turning off the freeway and into the Connecticut countryside for their honeymoon.

They had taken a nice colonial house outside Olivertown, thirteen miles from Danbury. The house belonged to one of Portia's clients (she was a dog-walker, traipsing three times a day around Central Park with a variety of canines). The Carpenters were on FM radio, telling the world how they'd like to teach the world to sing, and the happy couple were singing along.

They'd got through Abba, Dr Hook and the Medicine Show, Jo Stafford, and were nodding their heads gently along to Helen Reddy singing about how good it was to be insane: 'No one asks you to explain' they sang in unison as they pulled up outside the house they'd rented.

Portia looked at her new husband. 'Well, Mr DiCotta, we're here.' 'We sure are, Mrs DiCotta.' Donnie winked at her.

'Gotten used to that yet?' 'Never will, I reckon,' she laughed. 'But I like it just the same.' She leaned across the car and kissed Donnie as he switched the ignition off.

And the radio kept playing.

As they separated, they both looked at the fascia of the stereo.

'That's not good, Donnie,' Portia DiCotta said. 'Must be a short somewhere.' He nodded. 'Darn it, I'd better get it fixed up now, hon.

Otherwise we'll have a flat battery tomorrow which would not be good as I want to take you up to that restaurant in New Preston. The food's gorgeous, the hospitality's first class and the view is to die for. You can look right down over Lake Waramaug and it's real romantic.' Portia nodded. 'You sort the car, I'll put some coffee on.' Donnie reached out to feel under the dash for a loose wire. There was a tiny spark of electricity and the radio fell silent.

'Well done you.' Portia smiled. 'Now you can help me get the cases out the back.' Donnie DiCotta said nothing. He just kept his hand under the dashboard of the jeep, staring ahead.

'Donnie?' Nothing.

Portia reached out to touch his shoulder, and he swung his head round to face her. Portia saw his eyes -- not the beautiful blue eyes that she'd fallen in love with. These had been replaced by two solid orbs of burning purple light, minuscule tongues of electricity sparking from his tear ducts.

She couldn't say a word because he grabbed her head and kissed her on the mouth. Full. Hard. But not at all passionate.

After a second or two, they broke apart.

And now Portia DiCotta's eyes were blazing with the same eerie purple energy.

Wordlessly, they got out of the jeep and walked to the porch, studying the night sky above them, until Donnie pointed up to the right, to a blazing star that, had he been an expert in such things, he'd have known hadn't been seen by human eyes for many centuries.

He and his new wife held hands and stared at the star.

'Welcome back,' they breathed together.

The Doctor was looking down on London.

'I can see why you like it up here, Wilf,' he said to the old man fussing beside him, sorting out a second little canvas seat for him to sit on. 'It's terribly… peaceful.' Wilf Mott nodded. 'Been coming here for years. Used to stare at the sky at night when I was in the forces. Used to navigate by the stars as well as the charts and stuff. The other lads thought I was mad, but you know what, Doctor, we never got lost. Not once.' The Doctor smiled at the older man and sat on the proffered seat. 'Thank you.' Wilf sat beside him and poured him a mug of tea from the thermos. The Doctor sipped it gratefully. 'Used to slip a bit of Mr Daniels' finest in there,' Wilf said. 'But her ladyship cottoned on and that was the end of that. Bleedin' doctors told her I had to keep off it.' 'Terrible bunch, doctors,' the Doctor laughed. 'But they often know what's best, however unpopular that makes them.' 'Subtle,' nodded Wilf. 'Sylv'll come round. Probably.' 'Really?' 'Nah,' and Wilf roared. 'Not a chance, mate.' The Doctor smiled again. 'You don't have a problem with me, then?' 'Oh, you make my Donna happy. Keep that up and you're fine with me. Do anything that upsets her, though, and you'll hear from me, even on Mars.' The Doctor looked surprised at this. 'How much has she told you?' 'Everything. Right from the off.' Wilf pointed at his telescope. 'I was up here, looking up into the sky when she told me about you. I didn't believe her at first.' 'Well, no one could blame you for that.' 'Truth is, I don't think I understood what she was actually telling me. Then I saw you after that fat business, flying through the sky, Donna waving down at me, and I realised it was all true. She keeps me up to date when she can. Postcards, emails. The odd gift. Still don't know what to do with the Verron medal. Or what exactly a Verron medal is!' The Doctor grinned. 'Marvellous race, Verrons. They have a brilliant air corps. Utterly useless, they haven't fought a war in a few millennia, but their air corps is their proudest achievement. It's a bit like you sending someone a three-bar DSO.' The Doctor shrugged. 'Hang on, when did she send you that, where did she get it from, and how on earth did she get it to you?' Wilf almost recoiled from the Doctor's stream-of- conscious barrage of questions.

'Not a clue. 'Ere, you don't need it back do you? I mean, it wasn't stolen? Donna hasn't nicked anything since those sweets from Woolies when she was eight. We made her take 'em back and apologise and everything.' 'No, no, I doubt she nicked it. Verrons are very generous. I just want to know when she met a Verron.' 'I'd hate to think my little girl was not being properly looked after, Doctor,' Wilf said, raising an eyebrow.

'Helios 5,' the Doctor said. 'Had to be there. Or Ylum.

I like Ylum, so did Donna -- very cosmopolitan. Or perhaps from the Moulin Très Rouge. There was a street market there. Or I suppose there was that day on—' 'Anyway,' Wilf cut across him, 'we came here for a reason.' 'A reason other than you wanting to check what my intentions were towards your granddaughter? And to give my left cheek a chance to cool down.' Wilf laughed. 'Oh, that's Sylvia's way, not mine. I know you're honourable. I also know Donna can take care of herself in that regard. Any dishonourability from you, you'd never hear the end of it. Literally.' The Doctor thought about 'oi' and decided yes, Wilf knew his granddaughter very well indeed.

Wilf adjusted his telescope. 'Look though here.' The Doctor did, and saw a star. A tiny little pinprick of light, flickering enough that every so often it seemed to vanish.

'Like it? 7432MOTT,' Wilf said proudly.

'I'm sorry,' the Doctor said, staring back at him again.

'They named it after you?' 'I discovered it. I joined a node. Not long after, I discovered that star. The RPS are doing me a dinner tomorrow night.' 'I node nudding anout nodes,' the Doctor said.

'Ah, well a node is—' Wilf started, but the Doctor waved it aside.

'I'm joking. I know what a node is. And I'm dead impressed, Wilf, that you have a star named in your honour and I'm even more overjoyed the Royal Planetary Society are throwing you a knees-up. And I bet you bought a new tie and everything. And I am so sorry to have to rain on your parade, but can I just point out that there's another new star, just down there. It's incredibly bright, just to the left of the sword of Orion.' Wilf leaned down and eased the Doctor aside. 'There?' 'No, there.' 'Oh, there. Yeah, we all like that one, too. It's very pretty.' 'Yeah, very pretty. A very pretty new star shining brightly in a constellation that it shouldn't be anywhere near. Thing is, stars of that magnitude and shininess don't just show up for no good reason.' 'Shininess? Is that a technical term?' The Doctor threw Wilf a look. 'It's good enough for me.' 'Only I know that everyone who's been talking about it calls stars like that Chaos Bodies, apparently.' The Doctor thought for a second or two, then shrugged.

'Do they? That's a new one on me.' 'It's what they called it in the papers.' The Doctor nodded. 'Ah, well, if the newspapers said it, it must be true, because who on earth would argue with the tabloids.' He looked up at the thing in the sky. 'Chaos Bodies. Good descriptive name though, they got that right.' The Doctor threw an arm around Wilf's shoulder.

'But you know what, who cares? You got a star, a much less worrying star, named after you and I'm very proud.' 'Thank you. I'm glad you said that cos you have just solved my problem for me.' 'What problem is that?' 'I need someone to take me to Vauxhall.' 'Why?' 'The dinner.' 'Who with?' 'The Society.' 'When?' 'Tomorrow night.' 'How?' 'By TARDIS?' 'Yeah, cos that's gonna happen.' 'Well all right, on the tube, then. Sylvia thinks I'm not capable of going by myself. I mean, I'm fine sitting in a cold, damp allotment every night, which plays havoc with my—' 'So Sylvia doesn't want you going out late at night, right?' 'I mean, I'm not gonna get lost, Doctor, but she's getting all protective and daft these days. Since she lost Geoff. And with Donna away so much. And now Netty…' 'You know what, Wilfred Mott, I should be delighted to accompany you to dinner in Vauxhall. By taxi -- how posh is that? I haven't had a meal at the RPS since Bernard and Paula took me there in 1969 to watch the moon landings.

Do they still do that chocolate syrup pudding?' 'I don't know. I haven't been before.' 'Then tomorrow night, Wilfred Mott of Chiswick, assuming the menu hasn't changed in forty years, and being the Royal Planetary Society I think I'm on safe ground there, you are in for a culinary treat.' The Doctor looked at the worryingly bright new star that wasn't 7432MOTT one last time through the telescope. 'Chaos Body indeed.' 'It is beautiful though,' Wilf murmured.

And both men suddenly shivered. Like someone was walking over their graves.

Or the grave of the entire planet.

'Beautiful Chaos,' the Doctor said quietly.
