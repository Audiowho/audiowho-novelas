# SUNDAY

When she was growing up, Donna had heard the phrase 'the shot that was heard around the world' used to describe the effect the assassination of US President John Kennedy had on the whole of western civilisation. People always said they could remember where they were when it happened.

As a child of the 1970s, she grew up hearing about things like the moon landing, the murders of both Kennedys and Martin Luther King, and Winston Churchill's state funeral, but never wholly understood them. In a childhood of spacehoppers, Donny Osmond, chopper bikes and Green Shield Stamps, words like 'Blitz' and 'rationing' and 'bubble and squeak' just meant the old people were reminiscing about twenty years previously and probably moaning that the youth of today never knew when they had it so good.

The first time Donna had found herself saying that – to one of the neighbourhood kids who'd scratched her late father's car – she was appalled at herself. She had finally become exactly what she'd derided in her parents and grandparents when she was their age. Nowadays there was nothing she liked to hear more than Granddad Wilf go on about the war, his life in the parachute regiment or Nanna Eileen's days as a Land Girl.

Today was a day like 22 November 1963 – a day when another shot would be heard around the world.

Sunday had, to be honest, started pretty badly. Donna had woken in her bed (this was a good thing), although she'd only had about two hours' sleep (this was a bad thing).

Veena's tattered dress was chucked on the floor (bad thing); next to it, a receipt she had got from the minicab driver (bad thing – who was she gonna claim that back from?) who had driven her from somewhere called South Woodham Ferrers back to Chiswick. The receipt was for £225 (very, very bad – her account had to be empty by now). Wilf had been awake when she got back in (very good thing) and had listened as she told him everything that had happened at the Copernicus Array. He had held her tight, promised that they'd find a way to rescue the Doctor and sent her to sleep it all off.

Donna had been furious with herself – she'd left the Doctor there, she'd abandoned him in a way he'd never do to her (bad thing). But she was also practical. He'd told her to go, and that had been right because otherwise she'd have been killed (definitely a bad thing).

Donna felt like death but needed to get help and go back to the Array.

Perhaps she could track down Martha Jones and her mates at UNIT – she liked Martha and knew she'd drop everything to help.

As she reached the bottom of the stairs, she picked up the Yellow Pages and was already halfway to U when she realised that UNIT was unlikely to be there, filed under Military Organisations Dedicated to Wiping Out Martians (neither good nor bad, just a bit trigger-happy).

'Well good morning, madam,' Sylvia Noble snapped across the hallway. 'I was worried about you last night.' 'Why?' 'Oh, I don't know. Crawling back in at the crack of dawn after a night clubbing with the Doctor? At your age? I mean, clubbing's great when you're 21, but when middle age is only a few birthdays away—' 'Oi!' 'Whatever. Point is, it's time to grow up, young lady.' 'Thanks, Mum. Too old to go clubbing, not too old to live with my mother. Great.' 'No one forces you to live here,' Sylvia said, putting a cup of tea in Donna's hands. 'Not that you do much these days. Off with Daddy Longlegs for weeks on end.' Sylvia tugged at Donna's dressing gown, tightening the belt, straightening out the collar. 'And where's he today, then? Dragged your granddad off up the allotment, no doubt.

And it's not a warm morning, and he's left his thermos here.' Sylvia licked her forefinger and de-smudged a mark on Donna's left cheek. 'Still, I imagine they'll both be back for lunchtime. Sunday roast and all the trimmings? Ha! They wish. Tell you what, it's a trip to the Jolly Lock Keeper and the all-you-can-eat for a tenner today, my girl.

Those days of my slaving over beef and Yorkshire pudding went with your dad, let me tell you.' Sylvia eased Donna's red hair behind her ears and flicked her fringe.

'And there was a note left for you last night, found it when your granddad woke me up, staggering in after you'd dropped him off. I didn't read it, but it's from those Carnes boys the Doctor was on about.' Donna wanted to ask how she knew who it was from if she hadn't read it, but that way led to whole kettles of fish about notes from headmasters when Donna was twelve to letters from Martyn Hart when she was fifteen and who had opened which of those when they were addressed to the other, so she kept quiet.

Donna also had a pang for roast beef and Yorkshire pud, conjured up by her mum, covered in fantastic gravy.

Dad carving. Granddad and Nanna over for the day, blathering on about train times and the car collectors club and long walks in Windsor Great Park. Suddenly she wanted to be ten again.

And wanted to cry.

'Mum?' 'What?' 'I miss Dad.' And Sylvia Noble hugged her daughter in a way she hadn't for quite a long time. Then pulled away, almost as if she'd remembered that Sylvia Noble's preset was to be grouchy and uncompromising and not tactile and warm.

Especially with her wayward daughter.

But it was enough of a moment to make Donna happy.

Because it had been a real instinctive gesture.

'Can you call your granddad, please, find out when he's back and whether your Doctor is joining us at the pub.' 'And Netty?' (Ooh, very bad thing) 'If we must.' Eager to change the mood, Donna opened the front door to check on the weather.

'Mum, why d'you say Granddad's gone to the allotment?' 'What else does he do? It's either the veggies or Netty.

When they're not one and the same.' Donna shot her a look and Sylvia had the decency to apologise. 'Sorry. Get used to being on my own so much, I forget that I shouldn't say to other people things I say out loud to myself.' 'We'll worry about you and Netty later. Granddad's taken the car. Which he doesn't need for the allotment.' Sylvia frowned. 'He didn't say he was taking it. Said he was going to meet the Doctor.' 'So you assumed it was at the allotment?' 'Like the other night, yeah.' Donna was dialling her grandfather on her mobile, but it was switched off. The silly beggar was on his way to Copernicus, wasn't he? And he'd left Donna behind.

At which point that 'shot heard around the world' moment occurred.

Donna would always remember that she was in her dressing gown, standing at a slightly open door, a note from the Carnes boys in her hand (unread, by her at least), staring at a space where a car should have been, her mum just behind her. There was a fresh mug of tea by the Yellow Pages. Over the road, old Mister Lyttle was walking his dog. A small black thing of indeterminate breed that always smelled of wet fur. To the left, a real peripheral vision type thing, a blue van was parked.

And dominating the blue sky was a massive, ferociously awful pillar of pure bright light, the very edges suffused with a faint purple glimmer.

Donna heard her mum say, 'Oh my God, not again, not the sky on fire again.' But it wasn't entirely on fire. Just this one column, accompanied by a sound like a gas flame on the cooker, but ramped up by ten thousand decibels.

Donna just knew that something awful was happening where that column of light hit the ground, somewhere to the west of Chiswick. Although she didn't know it then, all around the world, no matter what time zone, similar columns of heat energy were doing the same.

And in the sky, that leering face of stars was still up there, the hideous grin seemingly wider and broader than ever before.

'Mum, inside, now. Lock the doors, let no one in except me. Or Granddad. Or the Doctor. Especially the Doctor.' 'And why is he so special?' 'Oh, just say you'll do it, will you.' 'All right,' Sylvia muttered. Then: 'And where are you going?' 'I need to try and find him. Both of them actually.' 'Aren't they together?' 'That's what I'm worried about.' 'Well, you can't go out like that.' Donna realised she still wasn't dressed and ran upstairs, throwing off her dressing gown when she was barely through the door of her room.

'Don't leave that lying on the floor,' Sylvia called.

Donna picked it up, hung it on the door hook and sighed.

'Priorities, Mum,' she muttered.

Dressed in a T-shirt and an old tracksuit she couldn't believe she ever wore but knew would be warm, Donna headed back downstairs, grabbing a heavy coat.

Out in the street, she could hear people and cars revving up. Everyone had seen the pillar of light and now they were seeing that awful face in the sky.

Give it half an hour and it'd be panic on the streets, rioting, looting and police everywhere. She had to get out of London fast.

'No car,' she cursed to herself.

She opened the front door – that blue van.

So wrong. So wrong, Donna Noble. So wrong.

Then she was at the driver's window, looking at the seat. The dashboard. The lack of keys. The locked door.

Poor Miss Oladini had made it look so easy when she'd hotwired that car, but Donna didn't have a clue where to begin.

Great.

She tried the door just in case.

It was open.

She glanced up the street but no one in the mêlée of people was yelling at her or claiming the van as theirs.

She hauled herself into the driver's seat and put her hand under the seat to adjust it. God knew why – she wasn't going anywhere, because no one in this day and age was stupid enough to put their keys under the seat of an unlocked van.

She brought up her hands, a bunch of car keys in them.

'And I want a tricycle and a pony and a lifetime's supply of milk chocolate,' she said aloud, putting her hand back under the seat just in case her Christmas wishes from when she was eight came true too.

No ponies, no bikes, not even a melted chocolate bar.

But the keys – that was good.

She ramped the van into reverse, and seconds later she was on her way back down towards Chiswick High Road, planning her second journey out towards Essex in twelve hours.

She threw a last look in the wing mirror at her house as she swung the van around and then shot off, hoping that her mum hadn't seen her do this. Cos then there'd be hell to pay. And quite right too! Before she had even got to the main road, the crowds were in the street, staring and pointing, and she could hear sirens from ambulances, police and fire engines all around her, all heading down towards the west, towards the M4.

Towards where the pillar of light had struck the ground.

She was heading towards London and that side of the street was relatively empty, even for a Sunday.

Donna's attention was drawn by the number of people outside the various electrical shops that dotted both sides of the street. Chiswick High Road had mostly been cafés and show shops when she was growing up, but this invasion of gadget shops was weird. She remembered the Doctor saying he'd met the Carnes boys in one.

All this went through her mind in a brief second, probably because there on the streets in front of her were Lukas and Joe Carnes.

Like they'd been waiting for her.

Literally.

Standing in the street. One minute, the road had been empty. The next, two lads were right in front of her.

Donna hit the brakes, and just avoided skidding to a halt, actually making quite a graceful stop, although a man behind her hit his horn.

'Yeah? What else didja get for Christmas, sunshine?' she screamed back at him. 'Shove it up yer—' The passenger door opened, and Joe and Lukas clambered in.

'Joe says we need to be somewhere called Copernicus,' Lukas said quietly. 'He also knew you'd be here. At this time.' 'Course he did,' Donna replied, driving forward as the irate driver overtook her, one hand off the wheel and gesturing at her. Shrugging, Donna continued driving towards Hammersmith. 'Morning, Joe,' she called to the boy, who was now in the back.

Joe didn't reply but got something out of his pocket.

'What's that then? New MP3 thingy?' 'It's an M-TEK,' Lukas replied on Joe's behalf.

'You what?' Donna tried to sound interested, but wasn't. She was more focused on how they'd known she would be there.

'It told him where you'd be,' Lukas continued. 'It talks to him.' That sort of answered her question, Donna decided, but annoyingly threw up a couple of dozen other ones. 'Is that how he knew the Doctor's name the other day, then?' Lukas shrugged. 'Dunno. Man in the shop gave it to him. Said it was a demo version. Gave out about ten of 'em. Said Joe was the right person to have one. He didn't tell me till we'd got home and I found him downloading music onto it.' That made sense to Donna, although it didn't really make any sense at all. When you travelled with the Doctor, you began to accept that things that didn't make sense really did make sense in a not-making-sense-to- normal-people kind of way.

So this M-TEK thing made Joe Carnes know things. Or it told him things. Things to attract the Doctor's attention.

'Didn't your dad ever tell you boys about accepting gifts from strange men?' 'My dad did,' Lukas said, glancing at Joe. 'Joe's dad didn't stick around long enough.' Well, thought Donna, that's a conversation killer. She made a sudden turn into the Hammersmith roundabout that caused someone to toot their horn. Maybe it was the same driver as before, but she didn't know or care. She turned onto the Talgarth Road.

It was empty. Really empty. This was a big six-lane roadway towards Central London, via Earls Court then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park and eventually into Piccadilly. It should've taken twenty minutes, maybe thirty to get to Piccadilly on a Sunday lunchtime, and that was without any road works. Donna did it in ten and she wasn't exactly speeding.

It was as if all the people in London were going away… no, going towards something. That light. They were all heading towards that.

Rubberneckers, eager to take photos on their mobiles and say 'oh look, we saw the carnage!' or something more sinister? In which case why wasn't she affected? 'Scuse me, boys, more law-breaking…' Donna got out her mobile as she drove and called her mum. No reply.

That wasn't good news.

So here she was, in a stolen transit van, driving through a deserted London, off to darkest Essex to rescue her granddad and her friend from killers, unable to contact home, complete with the Children of the Damned at her side.

'Cheers, Doctor,' she said to no one in particular.

Some twenty miles away from Donna and the boys, there was a massive police and ambulance presence around the Ruislip Woods area, with even more emergency services arriving from nearby RAF Hillingdon.

The massive bolt of white energy had struck the woodlands – one of Britain's first protected woods – although there wasn't too much to protect right now. It had created a massive bowl-shaped crater about a quarter of a mile wide, decimating the trees, grasses and shrubbery. A small waft of smoke drifted on the morning air and crowds of startled onlookers huddled close by, partly out of amazement, partly out of shock, but mostly out of fear.

Was it a plane crash? An al-Qaeda bomb? Something from the RAF base gone wrong? Casualties? Oh my God, my kids were playing here? Has anyone seen my dog, a lab cross? Excuse me, have you seen my husband, he was out jogging? Have you seen that awful face in the sky? Is it a movie stunt? I never trusted that IRA ceasefire… Police Sergeant Alison Pearce was trying to control the crowds and her own officers and get the emergency crews through. The Sunday morning shift had seemed such a good idea. Three kids meant that doing night shifts was out, but her mum could babysit on a Sunday while she did her shift. Normally, she'd be home by ten, see them asleep and get them off to school in the morning. She'd already called home and warned her beloved mother that grandparental care might be the order of the next couple of days. The paperwork alone on this would keep her busy. And that's assuming she ever actually got away from the site.

'Oi, you, excuse me?' she yelled out to a young guy who was trying to get under the red and white tape. 'Sir? You can't come through…' The man ignored her. Sergeant Pearce grabbed her radio and called a couple of colleagues over as she stepped under the line herself and hurried over to him.

'Welcome back,' he said to… well, to nothing. Just to the fine white ash that had once been trees and goodness knows what else.

'Sir, I must ask you to get back behind the line. This is a crime scene.' The man continued to ignore her, and Pearce noticed that five other people had done the same thing all around the perimeter. 'Guys,' she said into her radio, 'what's going on?' One of her constables reported back. 'We couldn't stop them, Sarge, they just got away from us.' Pearce sighed and reached out to the man, but he was on his knees now, reaching out to the ashen ground.

'Welcome back,' he said again.

And his fingers connected with the ground as Sergeant Pearce reached out to his arm.

She felt a shock, small, electrical, but powerful, and found herself a good couple of feet away, flat on her back, shaking her head to clear it.

The man was standing now, back to the crater of ash.

Pearce realised that the other people, now seven in total had done the same. It was like they were guarding the site.

The young constable who had spoken to her over the radio was at her side. 'You OK, Sarge?' he said, helping her up.

She pushed him away. 'I'm fine, Steve. What the hell is this?' PC Steve Douglas shrugged. Sergeant Pearce tried her radio but all she got was static crackle.

PC Douglas tried his. Same result. 'OK, this is dead weird,' he said.

Sergeant Pearce walked away and back under the line, telling Douglas to stay put and keep an eye on them. 'But don't go near them.' She hurried over to a growing group of fire and police officers, which now included her superintendent. 'Sir, we have a problem,' she reported, and explained that seven people were guarding the crater.

Superintendent Shakiri frowned and started to move forward, towards the perimeter. 'Get the public further back, Sergeant. Move the line another six metres.' She nodded, but still her radio wasn't working. Shakiri tried his. Nothing.

'It was working ten minutes ago,' he muttered.

'So was mine,' Pearce said. 'It must be something electrical.' 'Why'd you say that?' She told him about being touched by the man and the shock she'd had.

'Get yourself seen to by one of the paramedics, Sergeant.' 'I'm fine, sir…' she started, but he waved her away.

'Delayed reaction, Sergeant. You'd tell anyone else to do the same. And if they say you're fine, I'll see you in five minutes.' He smiled at her. 'Please?' Sergeant Pearce shrugged and walked towards one of the ambulances, while she listened to Shakiri yelling orders that the line was to be manually eased back.

As she reached the waiting paramedic, something… something instinctive made her look back. It was like a slow-motion moment in a movie, so much happened at once, she couldn't tell whether she saw it all or her brain pieced it together later.

A flash of purple light, like a bolt of electricity shot through the crowd of onlookers, flooring each and every one of them.

PC Steve Douglas vanished, although, for a split second, Pearce was convinced she saw him throw his arms up to protect himself from the purple flash, and she could see him – no, his skeleton – just for a second, then he was gone.

The seven 'guards', no longer hidden by the crowds, had stretched out their arms towards one another, and the purple electricity was connecting them all, like a rope.

Superintendent Shakiri threw himself down, dragging a couple of other officers with him in a rugby tackle, probably saving their lives.

There was a flash in the sky, like a sunburst, just for a second, and Pearce swore the whole sky flashed purple.

And then it was over. Sort of.

People were getting up and running further away. No one wanted to be near the electrical whatever-it-was. This was good in the sense that the public were going, but it was disorganised, and that was dangerous. If just one person fell… She remembered the story of a disaster in an East London tube tunnel during the war when it was being used as a shelter to hide from air raids. As the panicking public had scampered down the steps, one woman fell, bringing the whole crowd to the ground, killing almost two hundred people in the crush.

The panic going on right now, whilst not as confined, could be just as deadly. She saw Shakiri haul himself up, shouting to the officers around him to try and help the public. He threw a glance at where Steve Douglas had been standing – so he'd clearly witnessed it, too – and then back at her.

Waving the paramedic away, she ran over to join him at the scene. 'What the hell was that?' she breathed.

He pointed at the seven 'guards' around the crater. 'I imagine they wanted us all to go away.' He looked at the fleeing crowds. 'Any casualties?' Pearce just looked at where her young PC had been.

'Would we know?' she said. 'There's nothing left of Steve Douglas.' Shakiri caught her eye. 'And that's why we need to know if there are others. If we hold them accountable for one death, we need to hold them accountable for any others.' Both their radios crackled into life.

'Good morning everybody everywhere around the world.' It was a female voice, speaking clear, precise English. 'My name is Madam Delphi and I am the only voice you need ever listen to. I'm speaking to you all on every wavelength, every radio, TV, PC and PDA the world over. You have now seen what I can do and will continue to do. This planet is mine. You can all go back to your dreary little lives and wait for me to tell you what to do next. I now return you to your scheduled programming.

Oh, sorry, except for those countries currently broadcasting any version of Big Brother. Sorry, all the contestants and presenters of that show, wherever they are, are dead. You can thank me later.' The two police officers looked back at the seven people guarding the crater, that purple electricity still binding them together.

'Tell you one thing, sir,' Alison Pearce said, as she looked upwards to where it had all begun.

'What's that, Sergeant?' 'That scary face in the sky has gone.' Miss Oladini was seriously thinking of handing in her notice. This was not a good enough job to be worth all this aggro.

Last night she'd been chased, had electricity chucked at her, been nearly blown up in a car and, worst of all, someone had nicked her bike. She hoped it was that redheaded woman who had been with her in the car, because that would mean she too had escaped the blast.

Miss Oladini wasn't entirely sure how she'd done it herself, but knew it had involved a lot of rolling along the ground, ignoring the heat and running into a bush and holding her breath for what seemed like an hour but could only have been a minute or two before her pursuers assumed both women were dead.

She had no idea what was going on at Copernicus, but her body had given in to the shock and she'd fallen unconscious in the grounds of the old mansion house, eventually waking up again, cold, damp and very hungry.

And minus a bicycle.

She waited a while to see if anyone was watching her, then made her way back inside the house for warmth.

After a couple of minutes, she found a couple of abandoned coats. She knew she was in shock. Her body needed protection and warming up.

She put on the coats, one on top of the other, then headed for a tiny closet. She could hide there, and its cramped conditions would help retain the heat she needed.She found a half-drunk bottle of water on a table top and took that with her, too.

After a couple of hours, she felt strong enough to venture out of her closet and see if the people were still there, see if Professor Melville was still with them.

She'd been creeping quietly down a corridor when she jumped, because a load of radios and TVs and a couple of desktops burst into life, and she listened to Madam Delphi's portent of doom, feeling cold again.

Now she had recovered enough from last night's ordeal, now it was daytime, it was time to get away from Copernicus. Forget Professor Melville and those people, this was too much for her to deal with, and she suspected that radio broadcast was connected. The police, maybe the army, they needed to know that something was going on here. She began to creep slowly towards the big staircase when a hand came out of nowhere and wrapped around her mouth, cutting off any noise she could make.

Miss Oladini thought this was it, she was going to die.

'Please be quiet, sweetheart,' said a voice in her ear.

'My name is Wilfred Mott, and I don't want to hurt you.' He moved his hand away from her face, and Miss Oladini pulled away. She looked at the man, old, but not weak, clearly. His eyes burned with intelligence, but there was nothing threatening.

'Why are you here?' she asked bravely.

'My granddaughter was here last night. She told me about things going on here. I'm looking for the Doctor.' 'Granddaughter? Redhead?' 'That's Donna. You must be Miss Oladini? She thought you were dead, she'll be so pleased you're OK.' Miss Oladini wasn't sure about this. Those people that had attacked her could know all this. But would they know about…? 'How did Donna get away?' 'On a bike. Was it yours? She left it near a police station somewhere. South Woodham Ferrers, that was it.' He smiled at her. 'She got home so late last night and I'd been waiting up. She told me everything that happened, and after I got her off to sleep I decided to check on this place myself.' Miss Oladini frowned at him. 'You didn't believe her?' 'Course I did! Donna doesn't make things up. But I wanted to find the Doctor and keep Donna safe at the same time. She'd been through enough. So I left her sleeping and crept out of the house this morning.' He glanced at his watch. 'Right now she'll have worked that out and be creating merry hell, I reckon.' Miss Oladini still wasn't convinced, but he didn't seem to have the zombie-ish approach of the rest of the people here. 'You're looking for a doctor? Which one? They're all doctors and professors here.' 'He came with Donna. Tall bloke, daft hair. Talks a lot of rubbish.' 'Sums up most of the Copernicus workers, frankly, Mr Mott.' 'Wilf. And no, he doesn't work here. He was asked to come here by a Professor Melville. That's why he and Donna turned up so late.' 'I spent most of last night hiding and being blown up, I didn't see Donna till we escaped. No idea if there was anyone with her at all. Sorry.' Wilf seemed to deflate. 'Oh. I was so sure he'd be here.

I think he's the only one who can save us from all that Madam Delphi stuff we just had to listen to.' 'Why'd you think that?' 'It's the sort of thing he does. Save us.' 'Some sort of vicar is he?' Wilf laughed. 'No, no, not at all. So, where is everybody, then?' Miss Oladini shrugged and explained she was thinking of getting away.

'Give me fifteen minutes,' Wilf said. 'If we don't find my friend, I'll drive you back home, how's that?' Miss Oladini weighed up her options, and then agreed.

There was, after all, no other way home as easy as this.

And Wilf Mott didn't seem to be very threatening.

She led him down the stairs, through the shattered French windows and out into the back garden, pointing over at the radio telescope, explaining that was what the whole place was about.

Wilf nodded. 'That face in the sky, that was made up of stars, right? I reckon that observatory thing is where the Doctor would be.' Miss Oladini shivered and pulled her coats tighter around her. 'I'm not sure,' she said quietly. 'I don't want to go back there.' 'Why not?' But Miss Oladini couldn't explain. There was just something about it, something about the way the telescope had always seemed a safe place to work but now… Wilf gripped her shoulder. 'All right, you wait here and I'll pop over and see if the Doctor's there. Won't be long.' Miss Oladini watched as he wandered off. She shivered again. For one brief moment she had felt safe with this strange old man, and now she was alone again, she… She caught up with him in seconds. 'Entrance, this way,' she said.

He smiled at her. 'Good for you, girl,' he said. 'Didn't fancy going in alone. To be honest.' They smiled at each other.

'So, Donna's your granddaughter, then?' Miss Oladini said. 'Glad she got away.' 'Me too. Be lost without her. Family's an important thing to keep a hold of.' Miss Oladini considered this. 'I don't know where my family are,' she said. 'Probably back in Nigeria.' 'How come you lost touch?' She smiled. 'Oh, you know how it is, came to the UK for university, lost my status, stayed hidden here, signed on to the agency to find me work under a false name, usual stuff.' 'That's very brave of you,' Wilf said. 'Risky, too, working here.' 'Right under the government's nose,' she replied.

'Easiest way to disappear off the radar is to hide in plain sight. That's what my dad said last time I spoke to him.' Wilf agreed. 'Used to say that about spies, during the war,' he said. 'Best way to infiltrate was to be seen, so no one got suspicious. Just become a member of society.' 'That's what I did. Look where it's got me. Frightened for my life.' Wilf winked at her. 'You'll be all right.' They were at the door of the radio telescope. It was slightly ajar and they crept in.

Professor Melville was dead. There was no doubting that, his neck was at such a strange angle, and although Miss Oladini had never seen anyone dead before, she just knew it. Her hand was over her mouth, stifling the cry in her throat. Wilf checked the poor man for a pulse, but gently lifted his hand away.

It looked like he had been working at the guidance systems for the array when he'd died. When he'd been killed, Miss Oladini thought. After all, people didn't break their own necks.

Wilf was climbing up the small ladder that led to the upper deck, where the telescope itself was housed. It wasn't an old-fashioned tubular telescope, but a series of computers arrayed across the room, linked to the radio dish on top of the building.

That had always disappointed Miss Oladini when she first came to work for the poor Professor. Somehow a giant telescope seemed more romantic than a computer bank.

She glanced back at his body, eyes staring open at the ceiling, and thought about his old mother. And his cat.

And how scared she'd been of him the last time she had seen him. And now all she could think about was his cat.

And she began to cry for the first time since everything had gone wrong.

* * * Donna punched at the radio buttons until she got a station.

She didn't want music, she wanted news. It wasn't hard to find. All over the globe, massive beams of light had struck down, and been surrounded by people. Some observers were saying they were terrorists guarding a bomb site, some thought they were religious fanatics guarding something holy and special. Others reckoned it was aliens, coming to get those who had claimed to have been abducted and then returned with microchips in their heads over the last fifty years. The strange message from 'Madam Delphi', which everyone assumed was just an internet hacker trying to be funny, had started that one off… 'Irony is,' she said to the radio, 'that's the one that might be right!' There didn't seem to be too many casualties but no one could get near the people actually guarding the craters.

Britain, America, Russia, the Middle East, Asia, New Zealand, Africa, Greenland, nowhere was untouched.

There seemed to be no connection between the people gathering to guard those craters: different ages, sexes, politics, backgrounds.

'Wonder if the Poles got attacked,' she mumbled after listening to the reports for a bit longer as they drove past the Tower of London.

'There was a mention of one in Germany,' Lukas said.

Donna smiled. 'I didn't mean Poles in Poland, I meant the North or South Poles.' 'Does it matter?' 'Yeah, it probably does. They seem to be heavily populated areas, rather than desolate. So there's something significant about that.' 'What?' 'No idea. But I'm thinking.' She looked at a sign saying A13 Tilbury. 'Essex thataway.' Then she shrugged.

'Not that I know exactly where I'm going. It was dark last night and I was thinking about the Doctor too much to note landmarks.' 'You want to take the A127,' Joe piped up. 'Three miles along that after the M25 junction, then left into Meadow Lane, half a mile further on and right into Gorsten Road. Stay on that for six and a half miles, then left towards South Woodham Ferrers.' 'Oh yes, I remember that name,' Donna said. 'How do you know?' 'After passing under the railway bridge, you need to go eight miles on Tributary Road and as you get to the B8932, turn right into Allcomb Lane. Copernicus is two miles along there.' Donna looked at Lukas, who just shrugged. 'He knew where to find you,' he told her. 'And what van you'd be driving.' 'That's creepy,' Donna said quietly, glancing at Joe in the rear-view mirror.

'That's Joe,' Lukas said. 'Thank God we're only half- brothers.' 'Don't say that,' Donna chided him. 'He's still your brother.' 'Yeah,' Lukas agreed. 'But if we were full brothers, maybe we'd both be weird. This way, I can translate if he starts speaking Italian.' 'Why would he do that?' 'Cos that's where his dad was from, according to Mum.' And something flashed through Donna's mind.

Something the Doctor had said at the dinner the night before, when she was helping Netty out and old man Crossland had thought he was barking. When he was talking about that Mandragora thing.

I first encountered it in the fifteenth century in Italy.

Something in Donna's head sparked. Mad dolphins! Course! It couldn't be that simple, surely… but then, he said it was five hundred years ago. Plenty of time for people from Italy to travel the world, have generations of kids… That man, last night at the telescope who zapped the Doctor, his accent could have been Italian. And he had gone on about genealogy… 'Any idea where in Italy?' 'Nah,' said Lukas.

'San Martino,' Joe piped up.

'Thought you might know that,' Donna said.

'Why?' asked Lukas.

'Cos I don't think him being all Super SatNav in the back there is a coincidence. I think something is using him to get us to that telescope thing for a reason.' 'You mean my little brother is an alien?' 'Don't sound too excited by that idea.' 'Nah, it's dead cool.' Lukas leaned closer. 'I always told Mum he was weird.' 'He's not an alien. But there might be something in his background that'll help the Doctor sort this out.' Lukas glanced back at his brother, who was now listening to his M-TEK again. 'I don't want anything to happen to him though.' Donna smiled at him. 'It won't, the Doctor'll make sure he's safe.' But inside, she wasn't quite so sure she could guarantee that.

The Doctor's eyes opened and Wilfred Mott swam into view.

He grinned. 'Hullo, Wilf.' 'Hello, Doctor,' said the old man, hauling him up.

'What you doing on the floor?' 'I was dumped. Deposited. Abandoned. How rude!' the Doctor mumbled. Then he grabbed Wilf by both arms.

'Where's Donna?' 'She's fine. Safe at home with Sylvia, thinking we're both up at the allotment.' 'Good. Excellent. Brilliant even. Now then, why did they leave me here?' 'That weird lot with the purple electricity?' 'Yes, that's them. Blimey, Donna doesn't miss much out, does she?' 'I made her tell me everything. Doctor?' 'Yes?' 'There's a dead man out in that officey area.' The Doctor opened his mouth to speak, then stopped. 'I was afraid of that.' He followed Wilf out of the control room, casting one last look around, and squinting at some numbers on a screen. A moment later, he was laying Melville's dead body out on the floor, checking him.

'You must be Miss Oladini?' he said.

Miss Oladini nodded. 'How…?' 'I knew they were searching for you. Professor Melville asked me to try and find you. Keep you safe. And something about a cat?' 'Professor Melville was alive then?' 'Oh yes. They were forcing him to move the radio telescope into alignment with the Chaos Body up there.' Wilf filled him in on the developments around the world.

'Madam Delphi?' 'She writes astrology columns in the papers,' Miss Oladini threw in.

The Doctor gave her a look.

'Sorry,' she said. 'Pointless information, I know.' 'Oh no it wasn't, Miss Oladini. Brilliant info, actually.

Explains so much. If you are an alien super-being whose helix power is governed by the stars, then who better than an astrologer whose words are read and devoured by millions to use as your medium. We need to find this Madam Delphi and ask her where she gets her information from.' 'Why'd they kill Professor Melville?' Miss Oladini asked quietly.

'Mandragora is a great one for tools. All those people you saw last night? Tools. Tools to be discarded once they're of no use. I imagine poor Professor Melville did what he needed to do for them and they merely tidied up after themselves.' He put a hand of Miss Oladini's shoulder. 'A stupid, pointless waste of a good man and a friend. I'm sorry.' She smiled at him. 'Is there anything I can do to help stop them?' The Doctor looked back into the control room. 'Wilf, any sign of anyone else here?' 'No one.' 'I think they all left about nine o'clock this morning,' Miss Oladini added. 'I couldn't see much, but I heard them speak.' 'Car, Wilf?' 'Out the front.' 'Good, give it to Miss Oladini.' 'Why?' 'Yes, why?' 'Because you are alive, Miss Oladini, and I made a promise to a man to keep it that way. Go home. Wilf, phone?' 'It's dead, I never recharge it.' ' Phone? ' Wilf dug it out of his jacket pocket, and the Doctor sonicked it, then dashed back into the control room. A moment later, he returned and gave the phone to Miss Oladini. 'Recharged, should last a couple of weeks. Wilf, sorry, had to wipe the sim card.' 'The what card?' 'If you don't know, never mind. Miss Oladini, stored on that sim card are the coordinates the telescope is currently positioned to. I've also done a bit of nifty-swifty kinda stuff, meaning that when I call you on this phone, you are not to answer.' 'How will I know it's you?' 'Cos no one else is likely to ring it as they know its daft owner always keeps it off and lets the battery go flat.' Wilf harrumphed.

'So,' the Doctor went on, 'when I call you, don't actually answer, but instead, press the hash key. And whatever happens, don't accidentally press it before I call you.' Wilf wanted to know why, but the Doctor shook his head. 'Safer all round if you don't ask. Miss Oladini, do all that, and you may be responsible for saving the world.

Possibly the entire universe. Wilf, keys.' Wilf reluctantly handed them over and Miss Oladini gently put the phone into one of the pockets of her many coats.

'Good luck, Miss Oladini. And thank you,' said the Doctor. 'Off you go.' She gave a last sad look at Melville. 'He was lovely,' she said simply.

'I know,' the Doctor said. 'Met him in 1958. He had a skiffle band, called The Geeks – I played washboard for him. Joe Meek was gonna produce the album. We called him “Ahab” cos his surname was Melville. To this day, I don't know what his real first name was.' 'Brian,' Miss Oladini said. 'That's what his personnel file said.' She smiled a sad smile at the Doctor as she headed off.

'Brian,' said the Doctor to the body. 'Goodbye, Brian.' Wilf looked after Miss Oladini. 'Will she be OK? If those people are still watching us?' 'Nah, they've gone. She'll be fine, only lives locally, you'll be able to pick the car up next week. If we're all still alive.' 'Charming.' 'Always a risk.' He glanced up at the clock. 'I reckon we have about an hour to find out why they left me alive.' 'Then what happens?' 'The cavalry.' Dara Morgan was standing in the penthouse of the Oracle Hotel, staring down at the elevated motorway below.

'They look like ants.' Caitlin was at his shoulder.

'Which is pretty much what they are.' Dara Morgan opened his mouth, as if to speak, then shut it.

'You OK?' Caitlin asked.

He shrugged. 'I… I seem to remember something. Toy cars. I can see loads of little metal cars being played with by a child. The boy seems…' 'Familiar?' 'I was going to say “happy”, actually.' Dara Morgan moved away from the window. 'Madam Delphi,' he said to the computer screens assembled across the desks lined up along one long wall. 'How are we doing?' 'It's fantastic,' the computer replied, waveforms positively glowing. 'All over the world, the children of Mandragora are linking up, protecting the sites of arrival.

And MorganTech now controls eighty-seven per cent of the world's computer franchises.' Madam Delphi giggled.

'Stick that in your pipe and smoke it, William Henry Gates III.' Caitlin started reading off some internet reports.

'There's a new cult of Mandragora in South America now,' she laughed. 'How far did Mandragora go back then?' Madam Delphi's screens flashed. 'We went a long way.

Ooh look, a whole lineage trace in Norway. Is there nowhere we haven't reached?' Caitlin tapped a few more keys. 'And another in Zaire!' 'This truly is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius!' Madam Delphi cheered.

Dara Morgan was watching the cars again. And on the window, he was subconsciously drawing letters with his finger.

Caitlin glanced up. And frowned. Dara Morgan was drawing a C. And an F.

She was up and beside him instantly. 'Hey you,' she said, drawing him back. 'Madam Delphi has something to show us. A tenth of the world's population are joining us today. And when the M-TEK goes on sale this week, we'll have six times that many! Already the free prototypes we gave away have activated our sleeping brethren.' Dara Morgan gave a last glance back towards the window, towards the M4 motorway and then down at the potential M-TEK sales. 'Once Murakami has sorted things out in Tokyo…' 'This world and all its people will belong to Mandragora!' said Madam Delphi. 'Oh, and I've just uploaded a whole new batch of horoscopes. How marvellous!' Wilf had rescued an old coat from a room and brought it over to the observatory to cover Melville's dead body.

'Why'd they kill the poor man, Doctor?' The Doctor was in the small control room, carefully studying the readouts, equally careful not to touch anything. 'He probably set all this up for the Mandragora Helix, then they didn't need him any more. It takes a percentage of its power to control people – better to save it for those it needs long term.' 'Such as?' The Doctor turned away from the controls and ushered Wilf back towards the dead body, sonicking the door behind him. 'No one gets in or out until I say so,' he muttered. Then he smiled at Wilf. 'I wish I had an answer for you, Wilf, but truth is I've not got a clue. There's always a link between the people it enslaves and the people they enslave in turn. Right now, I have no idea what that is, or how your Madam Delphi fits in but I'm guessing she is linked to Mandragora.' Suddenly the Doctor slapped his hand to his head. 'Oh of course! I see it now! Wilf, what's the time?' 'Twelve thirty-five.' 'And you arrived here when?' 'About nine, I wanted to get here because—' The Doctor held up a hand to quieten him. Then he counted down. 'Five. Four. Three. Two. And… one!' At which point the outer door to the observatory was wrenched open, flooding the room with daylight.

Standing there, framed in it, was Donna Noble.

'The cavalry, as promised.' Wilf hugged Donna. 'How'd you know we were here?' The Doctor was leaning against the wall, arms folded, all nonchalant, but so proud. 'Aww, cos she's your granddaughter, Wilf, and she's brilliant.' Donna ignored the compliment. 'I know what that bloke meant last night. And he was Italian. It's the Italians!' Wilf looked from one to the other. 'What?' 'He said something about a man who licks mad dolphins.' The Doctor nodded. 'I know.' 'Oh.' 'But let's see if we agree, go on.' 'Or,' Donna grinned, 'if I'm righter than you?' 'Improbable, but always possible. Fire away.' 'What he said was “The man. He licks mad dolphins.” But he didn't say “mad dolphins”, he said “Madam Delphi”.' Donna smiled. 'Yeah, you'd guessed that, hadn't you?' The Doctor nodded.

'I'm still working on the bit about him licking her,' Donna went on.

The Doctor smiled at her. 'Helix. It's the Mandragora Helix, Donna. But I don't know why the Italian bit is important… Oh, oh, yes, of course!' 'Fifteenth-century Italy. San Martino, perhaps?' 'What are you two talking about?' asked Wilf.

The Doctor looked at him. 'Potted history, Wilf. 1492, I met up with this alien energy from the Dawn of Time.

Mandragora Helix, always striving to dominate the lesser species.' 'Who you calling lesser?' asked Donna.

'Fifteenth-century humanity, Donna. Not like twenty- first century humanity, oh no. You're far more sophisticated.' He smiled in a way that suggested this wasn't exactly how he perceived things, but she let it go.

'So, anyway,' he continued, 'I accidentally brought a fragment of the Helix energy to a small Italian principality called San Martino. I defeated it, very cleverly, by earthing it. Or so I thought. But that's quite literally what I did, shoved it into the ground, where it survived, trying to repair itself. Got into the land, into the water and ultimately into the people. A tiny biological entity attaching itself to chromosomes, DNA, whatever.

Transferred from generation to generation until the whole kit and kaboodle of Mandragora shifts itself halfway across the universe and links up. Last time, it wanted to halt human progress. This time, Mandragora's realised that there's no stopping you, you'll be out there, flooding humanity across the stars in no time, colonies, empires, wars and peacetimes, until the end of time. So Mandragora says, “I'll have a bit of that, thank you,” and glues itself to you for eternity. Great plan, it can manipulate you all for millennia to come.' 'So all over the world,' said Donna, 'diluted through breeding and whatnot, there are these descendents from San Martino all over the world. Thousands of them now, probably unaware half of 'em that they even have Italian blood in them. And Mandragora is controlling them.' She turned back to the Doctor. 'That's how Joe Carnes knew you were who you are. His dad's from San Martino.' 'How'd you know that?' 'Joe told her.' Lukas Carnes poked his head through the door. 'He's finished in the toilet, Donna,' he added as the two boys walked in.

'Oh yeah,' Donna smiled weakly at the Doctor. 'Say hi to my team of helpers.' The Doctor was overjoyed to see them. 'That's how you found us, wasn't it? I thought it was unlikely you'd memorised last night's taxi route.' 'Like a guide dog, Joe is,' Donna said.

The Doctor put a hand on Wilf's shoulder. 'We're done here. Let's go home. Via Greenwich.' 'Greenwich?' Wilf frowned. 'Oh no. No, Doctor, don't involve Netty. Please!' 'I really think she can help, Wilf. I'm sorry.' 'Who's that?' Lukas was pointing at the coat-covered body in the corner.

The Doctor took a deep breath. 'A good mate of mine, Lukas. He died.' And he threw a look at Wilf. 'But he's the last friend who dies at the hands of the Mandragora Helix, I promise you.' Donna took this in, remembering her promise in the van to Lukas about Joe. She hoped the Doctor wouldn't let them down.

As he passed her, he winked and smiled.

What was she thinking? This was the Doctor.

Of course everything would be OK.

How could it not be? The journey back to London was uneventful, to say the least. Wilf sat in the front seat next to Donna, wincing occasionally as she almost clipped wing mirrors on parked cars. The Doctor and the two boys sat in the back once they'd shifted blankets, a water bottle and a toolbox.

The Doctor had found a paperback book under a seat called A Dark and Stormy Night, all about rich kings, pirates, frightened maids, strong cattle herders and a young girl found in the snow. The Doctor sympathised with the story's hero, a young hospital intern who tried to piece the disparate elements together.

After a while, he'd given up and thrown it to the boys.

Lukas had eagerly started reading it, at the same time keeping a protective eye on Joe as the Doctor asked him about his long-lost dad.

He got no useful answers. Joe couldn't really remember going to the electrical shop on Friday afternoon – if it hadn't been for the free M-TEK prototype, he'd never even have known he'd been there.

'He has days like that,' Lukas muttered.

'What's an M-TEK when it's at home, then?' Lukas turned back to the book while Joe showed the Doctor the small portable device. 'It's like an MP3 player that plays movies as well,' said Joe. 'It connects to the net, it's a phone and it's got a 160-gig memory, so you can keep stuff on it. It runs Windows and OSX 6 really fast.' The Doctor nodded, impressed. 'Great things come in small packages,' he said, and promptly got out his sonic screwdriver and zapped the M-TEK with it.

Recognising that noise, Donna yelled back, 'Hope you're buying him a replacement.' But the Doctor was frowning. The sonic had done absolutely nothing. Not even scrambled the stored music.

'That's…' 'Weird?' Donna offered.

'More than weird,' he agreed. He scrambled to the back of the van, found the toolbox, took out a hefty hammer and brought it down on the M-TEK. The crash of the hammer, the yell of outrage from Joe and Lukas's very loud curse nearly caused Donna to mount the kerb as they turned into the Blackwall Tunnel.

'Well?' asked Wilf.

The Doctor held the M-TEK up. 'Not a scratch, not a dent, nothing. That's good tech. Alien tech, but good tech.

It's also impossible.' He smiled at the somewhat shaken boys. 'Oh, I do like a bit of impossible.' 'Anyone noticed anything odd?' Donna asked.

'We're still alive after you driving for an hour?' Wilf suggested.

'No traffic,' Lukas suggested.

The Doctor looked up. 'That true?' Donna nodded. 'Loads of parked cars. I've seen three other cars actually moving since we left Copper Knickers.

One of them kept flashing me, I thought he was cross about something.' 'Probably was,' said Wilf. 'You cut him up.' 'But I think he was trying to flag us down,' Donna ignored her granddad. 'Cos this is just mad. Where is everyone?' 'It's Sunday?' the Doctor suggested.

'It's South East London,' countered Donna, 'and we're not in the tenth century. There should be hundreds of cars.' 'I quite like it,' Wilf said. 'Everything peaceful. Take the next junction, sweetheart, Netty lives just off the main road.' They pulled up outside Netty's house in silence.

Wilf got out and rang the doorbell, but there was nothing. He called for her through the letterbox and, after a second or two, the door opened and he was yanked in, out of sight.

Donna, in the front of the van, glanced at the Doctor.

'Didja see that?' 'It was Netty,' the Doctor said.

'How'd you know?' 'Aliens would never wear hats like that.' The door reopened and Wilf emerged, followed by Netty in a green felt hat with a peacock feather in it, all very 1950s.

'You seen the news, Doctor?' asked Netty, hauling herself in and sitting herself next to Wilf.

He said he hadn't.

'Then the best thing we can do is drive through Central London.' Intrigued, Donna restarted the van and off they went.

Through Greenwich, past the rebuilt Cutty Sark and all the markets and shops. Through New Cross, down the Old Kent Road, around the Elephant and Castle and over Blackfriars Bridge.

'Not a single soul,' Wilf said. 'No one.' 'The BBC were telling everyone to stay indoors.

Fairchild has declared a state of emergency.' 'Fairchild?' asked the Doctor.

'Prime Minister,' Lukas said with a sigh. 'Don't you know anything?' 'I know lots of prime ministers,' the Doctor said. 'But in this century they come and go annually, I think. This one clearly makes no impression on history.' Donna brought the van to a sudden halt and, very quietly, said, 'Oh.' Those in the rear of the van leaned forward. 'Oh indeed,' the Doctor said.

Because they could go no further. They were on the Embankment, just down from Charing Cross station.

As were possibly a million other people. Standing.

Still. Arms reaching up to the skies.

And all chanting quietly. 'Helix. Helix. Helix.' 'That's not good,' Donna said.

The Doctor passed her Joe's M-TEK. 'Call your mum, please.' 'Why?' 'Let her know we're safe and we'll see her tomorrow.' 'Priorities?' asked Donna.

'Keeping on the good side of your mum is a priority, Donna. For both of us. She'll be worried.' He turned to the Carnes boys. 'Then we'll phone your mother, she must be worried sick.' 'Won't be,' said Joe quietly. 'She'll be one of this lot.' Wilf was about to ask why, but the Doctor shook his head. 'Now, Joe, just cos she's your mum, she's not in any danger. None of these people are, by the look of it.' 'She gave birth to him. Maybe she's got this Helix gene thing?' said Lukas. 'Thank God I'm the older one.' Joe stared out of the van. 'What do we do to rescue her, Doctor?' The Doctor smiled. 'That's the spirit, boys, remember we can save her. We can save all these people.' Donna passed the M-TEK back. 'She says Chiswick's empty. I told her to stay indoors, drink tea and keep the TV on. I said to do whatever the BBC says unless it involves leaving the house or stopping drinking tea. She didn't see the funny side.' 'I'm not surprised,' said Wilf. 'Well, Doctor, what do we do?' The Doctor was looking at the M-TEK. 'They gave this to you, Joe, yeah? Have they given loads of free ones out?' Joe nodded. 'On the forum, they said they were giving out a million free ones before tomorrow's launch.' 'I bet the target audience was of very specific genealogy, too. So, this thing goes nationwide tomorrow?' 'Worldwide,' Netty put in. 'I'm going to get one. I like things like that. Was going to wait a month or so, see if the home shopping channel did 'em cheap.' 'Oh I like that,' Donna said. 'Well, used to. When I had time. That Anis Ahmed did things for me…' Netty laughed. 'So sexy…' Wilf coughed. 'Anyway, getting back to the matter in hand. Doctor, we can't just park here.' The Doctor was still playing with the M-TEK.

'Nothing is that well protected… If I can just rewrite some of the software…' The sonic flashed a couple of different shades of blue, the M-TEK gave a ping, and the Doctor cheered. Then stopped. 'I appear to have accessed a horoscope website. Ah, our old friend Madam Delphi.' 'She works for the people who made the M-TEK,' Lukas said. 'She writes her horoscope things for some of their papers.' The Doctor stared at the youth. 'You what?' 'MorganTech, they make everything these days. Run TV stations, newspapers, the works.' Lukas shrugged.

'Think a cross between Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and Richard Branson and you have Dara Morgan.' 'And who's he when he's at home?' asked the Doctor.

'He runs MorganTech. Been around for a few years now. We did some research on him at school, but there's not that much out there. He's not keen on unauthorised biogs.' The Doctor looked at the group in the van. 'So let me get this right. We have beams of light hitting the ground, hypnotised people chanting to the stars thanks to a newspaper astrologer telling you she's changing the world, new gadgets given away free to people who are of Italian descent and no one thinks to tell me they're all connected?' The others looked at each other. Donna spoke eventually. 'We can't be expected to make the leaps of logic you do, you know.' 'They're not leaps, they're clearly defined paths of evidence and… oh, never mind. Where do I find this MorganTech?' 'Near where we live,' Lukas said. 'In Brentford.' 'Oh that's right,' Wilf said. 'They have that big office and hotel complex on the Golden Mile.' 'And the guy in charge is called Dara Morgan?' 'Yup.' 'Course he is,' the Doctor muttered. 'He would be.

Lukas, I want you to try and remember everything you can about him, all right?' The Doctor chucked the M-TEK onto the floor, and Joe went to scoop it up. 'Leave it alone, Joe – it's dangerous.' He sonicked the back of the van, and the doors sprang open. 'Come on, we're not going to get past this lot, we need to walk and find new transport.' 'Doctor,' Wilf protested. 'Netty's…' 'Hey,' Netty said. 'I can walk as well as you can, Wilfred Mott.' She linked her arm through his. 'We can support each other.' He smiled down at her.

And Donna was going to do the same until she saw the look on the Doctor's face.

Like it had been at dinner the night before.

He was looking at Netty… strangely.

Donna pulled the boys closer to her. 'Stick with me,' she told them, 'and we'll help the Doctor put an end to all this.' 'Donna,' the Doctor said suddenly, and in a way Donna had got used to. It was his warning voice.

Between them and the chanting crowd was a group of people. People Donna recognised from the night before, at the Copernicus Array.

'Not good?' 'Not good.' 'How did you reprogram the M-TEK?' asked the little man at the front of the group. Donna remembered him, too. He had led them, and she realised from his accent he was, of course, Italian.

'Talent,' the Doctor said.

'That is not part of the plan,' the little man said. 'We cannot allow a weak link in the chain.' 'Oh, sorry,' the Doctor said, indicating with his hand for the rest of his group to move away, slightly behind him, leaving him stood between the Mandragora-powered group and the van. 'I left it in the back. Do you want me to get it?' 'You will leave it,' the Italian said, as he pushed past the Doctor and clambered into the van.

The Doctor smiled at the rest of the group. An elderly duo to one side, four younger people at the back, a heavily built man to the left.

'I wonder how many of you are actual San Martino descendents, and how many are just their… slaves? Helpers? Unwitting participants in the murder of innocent professors at observatories? If you can fight Mandragora, maybe we can—' The Doctor hit the tarmac hard as the blue van exploded into flames and debris.

Donna and the boys were already running, Wilf and Netty, staggering after them.

Good.

He glanced at the funeral pyre for the little Italian man that had once been a van.

'That's one way of eliminating the weak M-TEK, I suppose,' he said. 'Bit OTT if you ask me though.' And he got up, to be surrounded by the group. The burly man seemed to be their new leader and when he spoke, the Doctor recognised a strong Greek accent.

'Madam Delphi wants to see you.' 'Well, all right, but I want to check my friends are OK.' 'They're coming too.' 'Aw, I'm not sure I agree to that part of the deal.' 'Or we kill you now,' the Greek added.

At which point Wilf, Netty, Donna and the boys emerged from hiding and were quickly rounded up.

The Doctor sighed. 'I think that was probably a bluff,' he said to Wilf. 'They wanted me alive, remember?' 'We're in this together,' Wilf said. 'When I was in the paras, we never left anyone behind.' The Doctor nodded. 'Oh well, now we're all here. Got a firm's coach?' 'We walk,' said one of the older people, an American woman.

'It's a long way,' Donna said.

One of the younger men shrugged. 'It'll keep us all fit, then.' And they began the walk across London.

Everywhere they went, little groups of people were together, chanting to the skies.

Others could be seen, hiding, scared, occasionally looting shops, probably assuming this wasn't going to be cleared up any time soon, and that food would become scarce.

'It's like the Blitz,' Netty said at one point, as they walked through Leicester Square.

'Without the bombs and collapsed buildings,' the Doctor said. 'Thank goodness.' The Doctor allowed his group to separate slightly, Donna noted. She was bringing up the rear with the boys, and Wilf was getting tired, and was only a few steps ahead. Behind her, the Greek man and older Americans.

Ahead of the Doctor, the four younger people.

The Doctor was with Netty, having swapped places with Wilf, his arm now linked with hers.

Donna couldn't hear what he was saying, but Donna could tell from the urgency he gave off in waves and the lack of response from the old lady other than the odd nod, that they weren't really discussing London's architecture.

She almost asked her granddad what he thought it was about, but didn't. Because if it went wrong, if it all turned out bad, she didn't want him blaming the Doctor for anything.

Donna realised this was the first time she'd actually found herself questioning the Doctor's actions for quite some time. And she didn't like it.

A couple of hours passed. They had been allowed to stop occasionally, the younger people sorting out food (usually by using their Mandragora powers to blow doors off shops and nick stuff).

At one point, the Doctor and Netty had sat together in a deserted burger place, while the boys munched on cold chips and muffins. Netty had found some paper on a clipboard and was writing something on it, and the Doctor was nodding.

Wilf asked Donna whether there was any point in trying the microwave ovens, and when she glanced back Netty was alone, and the Doctor was trying to talk to the Greek man.

There wasn't time for microwaving burgers, as they were told to start walking again, despite the Doctor's protestations.

The boys were soon tired again. Netty and Wilf were very tired indeed. Donna was utterly exhausted, but the Doctor… he just kept going. He had Lukas and Joe up front with him now, trying to take their minds off it all by giving them a history of Cromwell Road and the various buildings as they marched along it.

The old American couple by rights ought to have been dead on their feet, but no, they were always there, one or other, sometimes both, with their arms pointing forward, ready to use their Mandragora power as she'd seen at the Copernicus Array the night before.

It was dark by the time they reached Hammersmith, and Donna reckoned it would take another hour or so to reach Brentford. Possibly longer, as Netty and Wilf were stopping more and more often.

'My granddad is very old,' she said at one point to the Greek man, eliciting an outraged, if exhausted, 'Oi, I'm fine' from Wilf.

The Greek man just shrugged and said that Madam Delphi would not be kept waiting.

It wasn't a cold night, but neither was it the height of summer and, by the time they started walking down the carless, people-free Great West Road, it was nearly midnight.

Donna was with the Doctor. Wilf and Netty were with the Carnes boys.

Wilf tried to keep their flagging spirits up with tales of his exploits in the parachute regiment, like he'd done for Donna when she'd been their age, albeit on long car trips rather than painful hikes across scary cities.

'Why don't you let these people go home?' the Doctor suggested, stopping suddenly. 'Madam Delphi only wants me, I'm sure. Look, we're in Chiswick. Let Donna take Wilf and Netty home. And let the boys head off, too.

Please?' The Greek ignored him and kept going.

'Not that Gramps or I would leave you for a moment,' Donna hissed at him as she walked to catch the Doctor up, 'but why do you think they do want all of us?' The Doctor looked her in the eye. 'Insurance,' he said simply. 'Threaten to hurt me, no use. Anyway, they need me alive for whatever reason. Threaten to kill you, it's leverage. Sorry.' 'Don't be,' Wilf said. 'We chose to get involved with all this. I'm proud to stand beside you, Doctor. So are my soldier boys here.' The Carnes lads nodded, Lukas a little more enthusiastically than Joe, it had to be said.

The Doctor looked at Netty. She was starting to walk erratically, drifting towards the central reservation of bushes.

'It's the exhaustion,' the Doctor said sadly as Wilf headed over to guide her back to the group. 'Her mind's going again like last night.' 'Then why'd you bring her?' Donna said a little more aggressively than she'd intended.

'I didn't expect to be walking,' the Doctor said. 'I'm sorry.' Donna let herself drop back a couple of steps.

Something in the Doctor's plan had gone wrong, and he was actually worried.

That wasn't a good sign.

Suddenly a set of headlights flashed ahead of them and, as one, the Doctor's group shielded their eyes. A small minibus screeched to a halt in front of them.

'Hey,' Donna yelled. 'You gotta help us!' The Doctor went to stop Donna, but it didn't matter.

The minibus door opened and a woman called out.

'Hop in, folks,' she said in a cheery Irish accent.

'Madam Delphi's waiting.' One by one, they piled in.

'You couldn't have come about three hours ago?' Wilf grumbled as he helped a confused Netty up the steps into the vehicle.

The woman laughed. 'I'm Caitlin and, on behalf of MorganTech, I apologise for your discomfort. But that's nothing to what's coming. And no, Madam Delphi believes exhausted prisoners are far more malleable than fit and able ones. The only reason I'm here is it's nearly midnight. And time's getting on. Hold tight!' Caitlin did a U-turn and roared off down the A4, towards the Brentford business area known as the Golden Mile.

'Here we are,' Caitlin said, slowing down.

Ahead, Donna saw the Oracle Hotel loom out of the darkness, lights on in every window.

'Ha!' the Doctor laughed. 'We're going to see the Delphi at the Oracle. Very witty. Not.' 'It's midnight,' Caitlin announced as she pushed the minibus doors open. 'Today is now Monday. The universe will never be the same again.' And she smiled.

And Donna shivered.
