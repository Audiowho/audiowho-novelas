# MONDAY

The Doctor, Donna, Wilf and their friends were led up to the penthouse suite by Caitlin, who kept her hand resting on the butt of a revolver tucked into the waistband of her trousers.

As the Irishwoman pushed the penthouse doors open, the Doctor marched in and glanced around. He began clapping slowly when he saw what was inside.

'Madam Delphi, I presume?' he said. 'Of course.

You're not a real person, are you? You're a computer! Well, I say a computer, more of an artificial intelligence, housing an ancient malevolence that should never really have been freed from its dimension. How are you, Mandragora? It's been a few centuries.' 'This... form is oh-so much more capable than a fleshy human body, Doctor,' Madam Delphi said. 'As a Time Lord, as someone who can stand so much more spatial and temporal trauma, your body is just what, if you'll excuse the excruciatingly bad pun, the Doctor ordered.' The Doctor said nothing.

'You've heard that one before, haven't you?' Madam Delphi asked.

The Doctor and Donna now stood at the front of their exhausted group, Wilf, Netty, Lukas and Joe hovering a few steps behind. Facing them, in a protective circle around the Madam Delphi computer, were Dara Morgan, Caitlin and the Mandragora converts who had walked them there.

'Oh, hullo,' said the Doctor, as if addressing a meeting of the WI. 'This all looks very impressive. Nice room.

Nice hotel. Nice gesture.' He pointed to where the old American lady had raised her arm in the now-recognisable Mandragoran position to fire a bolt of lethal Helix energy.

'Although a bit unfriendly.' 'I do apologise. You just can't get the staff,' the computer's feminine voiced boomed out from speakers dotted around the room. 'Welcome to my hotel. Can I recommend the gym? Great pool, I understand.' 'What's the bar like?' Donna asked. 'I mean, not exactly five-star without a good bar, is it?' 'Ah, Donna Noble, welcome to you, as well. I think you'll find we offer four bars, three restaurants and an à la carte room service 24/7.' Madam Delphi then chuckled.

'Gotta say, though, we aspire to a greater recognition than just five stars.' The Doctor nodded. 'Well, I reckon you're looking for about five million. What do you think, Donna?' 'Gotta have good service to get five million stars, Doctor. Do you remember that hotel on Cassius? That was a proper five-star hotel.' 'Oh yes!' the Doctor grinned at her. 'And they understood customer relations, too. Remember when we had that little problem with the lizard?' 'Do you get lizard problems in Brentford, Madam Delphi?' Donna asked. 'Cos if there's lizard problems to be solved, I don't think it's that great a hotel.' 'The Oracle is—' started Dara Morgan, but Madam Delphi shushed him.

'The Doctor and his sweet friend are just playing for time, Dara. Trying to figure out how to stop us, how to get out of the Oracle alive, how to “help” their precious planet Earth.' Madam Delphi took a beat then continued, more silkily and thus slightly more menacingly. 'But you really aren't going to stop us, Doctor. I offer no guarantees about people getting out alive. And, from my perspective, helping Earth is precisely what we are doing.' The Doctor walked towards the group, and they parted, almost reverently, so he was now looking straight at the screens of the computer.

'Last time we had a chat, I sent you into the darkness, licking your wounds. Remember that?' 'Of course.' Madam Delphi's sine waves pulsated ferociously. 'I have waited so long for a chance to get to you personally. To make you pay.' 'Oh, not the old revenge on the poor Time Lord schtick, Mandragora? I mean, you're better than that. Go on, give us a better reason.' Madam Delphi giggled. 'It's not the first time since 1492 that the Mandragora Helix has been to Earth, you know.' 'Yup, that I do know. The Sacred Mountain of Xi'an, if I remember? Then there were the Orphans of the Future, all that white and crimson cowl stuff. Oh and the Mandrake nightclub stuff, now that was pretty good, I have to say. But each time, it's just been a fragment of Helix energy, hasn't it, a little sparkler sent out to test the waters. This time, we've got the whole bonfire. So why now? Why send me little psychic-paper messages to get me involved, to bring me here... ahhh... Yes, you wanted to get me here. This exact day, this exact time. Why?' 'The stars are aligned,' Dara Morgan said.

'I'm talking to Madam Delphi, thank you, not the hired help.' 'How dare you—' Dara Morgan began.

'Oh, do belt up,' the Doctor snapped. 'I mean, who are you anyway?' 'I am Dara Morgan. I set up MorganTech. I created the M-TEK, I devised—' 'Oh please, you did nothing that the Mandragora Helix didn't tell you to. No, who are you really? Who did the Helix take, distort, manipulate and totally screw up before reimagining you as Dara Morgan?' 'What?' 'Lukas?' the Doctor barked. 'My research assistant,' he explained quietly to Madam Delphi. 'Donna was busy.

Family matters.' Donna frowned. Not that he was getting Lukas Carnes to do his research, but why he'd said 'family matters'. She threw a look at Wilf but he shrugged. Then she glanced at Netty, staring intently at the stand-off before them. When Donna looked back at the Doctor, she recognised a look in his eyes. A look that, if given voice, would have been some variation on 'I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.' 'No,' she mouthed. 'Don't you dare!' but the Doctor's attention was back on Dara Morgan.

'All over the world, Dara Morgan, billions of people will fall victim to this alien consciousness you've given access to the world. And that's going to happen today.' 'I know,' smiled Dara Morgan. 'How brilliant is that?' 'Well, it's brilliant from the point of view of your M- TEK being a pretty damn brilliant piece of technology, augmented by alien know-how and distributed quite magnificently to people who, I imagine, had no idea what it would do to them today.' 'Not a clue.' 'There's a lot of blood on your hands, Dara Morgan. If I were a policeman, I'd have you arrested but, as Lukas will now explain, that's not possible.' 'Dara Morgan came to prominence eight years ago, making his first claims about MorganTech on a news special, broadcast live on 31 December 1999.' 'End of the millennium, neat.' 'Before that, there's no trace of any such person.

MorganTech was registered as a private limited company at 5.29pm that same day.' 'So who were you before Mandragora got hold of you? Before reimagining itself as a human, becoming the anagrammatical Dara Morgan?' 'Oh, I get it now,' Wilf called out. 'That's very clever.' 'Yes, thank you, Granddad,' Donna hissed. 'But let the Doctor focus.' Before anyone could stop him, the Doctor put his hands to either side of Dara Morgan's head, fingers pressed against his temples and whispered, 'Open the locked doors, and let yourself out.' The assembled acolytes took a step towards the Doctor, and Madam Delphi pulsed menacingly. 'Stop him,' she said.

In his mind's eye, the Doctor could see an image. A dark night, cold, damp. He was walking down a lane, hedges high on either side, rain trickling down his neck.

He shivered. He was angry... No, not angry. Hurt.

Bewildered. She'd said no. No to what? Who was she? In his hand was a box, soft, velvety. And inside it, yes, he could imagine it. Silver band, plain diamond. All he had been able to afford. And she'd said no. Said that she needed to get away from Derry, wanted to go to Sydney.

Or San Diego. Or anywhere other than close to him. How had he got her so wrong? How hadn't he seen this coming? How was it possible to love someone that much, so that every time she walked into a room, every time she spoke, smiled, laughed, his heart would leap. That just knowing she was in the kitchen, in the bathroom, in the hallway was enough to send those fantastic, amazing, wonderful thoughts rushing through him? Yet when it came to it, when he'd said 'I love you', she'd said she wanted to get away. No 'I love you too, but...' No 'Thank you, but I'm sorry.' Just an 'Oh my God, are you for real? No, I'm getting away from Ireland as soon as possible. I don't want to be tied to anything here!' It was as if someone had ripped everything out of him that mattered and walked all over it.

You're not the first person to fall in love and be rejected, he told himself rationally.

But he didn't want to be rational. What was rational about being in love anyway? What was rational about offering yourself up to someone only to be squashed? And here he was, lost and alone. Everyone had said she wasn't interested. Everyone had tried to say he was wasting his time. But when you're in love, you grasp at anything, you believe that one day you'll wake up and they'll say, 'You know what, I'm wrong, you're right, you are the person for me.' But that hadn't happened.

It never happened.

Instead he'd seen the lightning ripping across the night sky as he stumbled along the road, tears mixing with the rain, thinking that all he wanted to do was be home now.

Home.

Ten minutes' walk, max.

More lightning. Blue, white and purple... Purple? It struck the ground in front of him, knocking him backwards.

He remembered seeing the little box with the ring vanishing in a sudden conflagration, literally and metaphorically drawing a line under that part of his life.

He felt as if he were on fire, too. All he could see was purple light, surrounding him now, blotting out the hedges, blotting out the road, the darkness, the rain.

And then the voice. All around. In his head. Coming from the sky and his heart at the same time.

'It is your time. Callum Fitzhaugh is no longer relevant. Now you have a greater cause.' The voice stayed with him long after the purple fire had gone, over days and weeks as he willingly gave himself a new purpose.

The next morning he touched the keypad on a cashpoint machine and it spurted out two hundred pounds.

Eight more cashpoints that morning. Then more in different towns. Then he set up an account. He manipulated the online banking, untraceable movements because he fed figures into the computers that erased all traces of his actions.

Within three weeks, he was a multimillionaire. He had buildings all over the world. He owned companies which he then closed or merged and, within a month, MorganTech had come into existence due to the manipulating influence of the voice in his mind that told him how to do it.

Next he had put together the computer system that would change his destiny. Somehow the voice guided him as he built Madam Delphi, felt that voice in his head transfer into the hardware, somehow, creating artificial life on a scale unheard of before now.

'I need you,' the voice had soothed. 'Now and for ever.

I need a human interface, a connection to the world of flesh and blood. An avatar in reality.' So Dara Morgan had been created.

He remembered coming from a rich family of bankers and investment traders. His parents died in a private plane crash, and MorganTech had passed to him when he was just 21.

He remembered more false memories, events, people, qualifications and parties. None of them real, but each time he imagined a part of the fictional history, it came true. The voice showed him how a society that relied on computers for information, that no longer used paper and ink to keep records, could so easily be manipulated in accepting the history, the lies, the fabrications you told it via the keyboard were true.

He remembered the voice telling him how to develop the M-TEK over a few years, so that the market would trust in it. Trust in MorganTech. This was a long game.

And he remembered seeing her in a street in Dubai one afternoon.

She was with a couple of men, going through a sheaf of documents in a roadside café.

He had listened as the men had explained that they needed to think about whatever deal they were doing and moved away. Then he went to sit beside her.

She looked up, initially intrigued, then surprised and then shocked. Eventually she found her voice. 'Cal?' 'Not now,' he said. 'Dara Morgan.' She laughed, a soft, gorgeous, beautiful laugh that brought back all that love he'd felt years earlier.

But the voice in his head hissed, 'No. Remember the ring. Remember the tears and the pain. Do not give in now, Dara Morgan.' 'You do look like him, Cal,' she said. 'What brings you to Dubai?' 'Mandragora will swallow the skies,' he said. 'Let me show you, Cait.' He took her hand, and her eyes flashed with violet Mandragora energy. Then she had opened the folders she had been going over with the businessmen earlier. 'Sign here please, Mr Morgan.' And he did, because the voice told him to.

Within an hour, MorganTech owned a chain of five-star hotels across the world, and Caitlin had become his first convert.

With a gasp, the Doctor pulled away from Dara Morgan, who immediately collapsed to the floor.

The whole thing had taken less than a second in real time but, to the Doctor, it had seemed like for ever.

He staggered away from Dara Morgan as the rest of the Mandrogara-influenced group turned on him, arms raised, ready to deliver the death blast.

'No!' Madam Delphi's sine waves were bouncing up and down on her screens. 'No, I need that body. It's why I have waited these long centuries for the Doctor to present himself. The last of the Time Lords, possessed by Mandragora Helix energy, animated by me!' The disciples lowered their arms.

And little Joe Carnes wrestled away from his brother and ran to the Doctor. 'No,' he yelled. 'Leave him alone.' Lukas was at his side in a second, and then Donna and Wilf were there, too.

They stood between him and the Mandragora- possessed computer.

'Yes, thank you all,' the Doctor said. 'But not really necessary.' He smiled at Madam Delphi. 'So what a lot of choices. Kids no one would take seriously, an old man with a heart condition who could drop dead at a moment's notice, his friend Henrietta, an expert on the stars...' He threw a look behind them all, a look only observed by Donna.

Henrietta Goodhart was still by the door, as if trying to make sense of what was going on.

The Doctor was looking at her with a mixture of sadness and... what was that, Donna wondered. Panic? Desperation? As if he were willing her to say or do something? But it was no good. Netty wasn't with them at the moment.

'The lights are on, but no one's driving.' The sort of thing Donna could imagine her mother saying. A horrible phrase, but one Donna couldn't disagree with right now.

And it was as if the Doctor thought Netty had let him down, somehow.

'Donna,' the Doctor hissed. 'Your mobile. Now.' She pushed it into his hand and, keeping an eye on Madam Delphi, he expertly scrolled through her address book.

'Donna?' 'Yes?' 'Why isn't your granddad's number in here?' 'Cos he never turns the bloody thing on. What's the point?' 'Oh great. Thanks.' 'Why are you ringing him? He's standing here.' 'His phone is in Essex. I need to call it.' Donna closed her eyes, imagining her fingers on the keypad and hissed the numbers at him. As she said each number, he pressed the key. When he heard the call go through, he hung up.

'I hope you're right, cos if you're not...' 'Someone just got a strange call?' 'And the world will end. But hey-ho, it's been fun.' He passed the phone back to her.

'You won't get him,' her grandfather was saying to the computer. 'This man is brilliant, he's saved this planet, the whole universe, probably, more times than we've had hot dinners. You'll have to go through us to get him!' God bless Granddad, but Donna seriously doubted that was going to stop Madam Delphi. The Doctor needed something from Netty, Donna was sure of that. So he needed to be bought time.

'You want a body to inhabit that's been round the galaxy, lady,' she said, 'take mine. Oh, I might not have two hearts or hair that defies fashion, but this body's seen a bit of outer space action.' She pushed the Doctor right behind them now, so he was closer to Netty.

Madam Delphi's screens pulsed again. 'Noble by name, noble by nature, is it?' 'Oh, like I haven't heard that before. One night when Neal Bailey decided to get frisky at the Odeon, he muttered in my ear, “Now cracks a noble tart, how about a good night sweet Donna.” I clumped him one where it hurts and walked out. Mind you, I reckoned he knew his Shakespeare and should've got Brownie points for originality. My dad didn't agree and bopped him on the nose down the pub the next week.' Donna smiled sweetly at the computer. 'Ever had a bloke come on to you? No, course you haven't, cos you're all electrics and wires and stuff. All alone, aintcha? That why you're doing all this, is it? Looking for love? Should've gone for the Lonely Hearts angle, instead of the astrology bit.' Wilf tugged his granddaughter's arm. 'You'll make it cross.' 'Really, Granddad? That had never occurred to me.' She winked at him. 'I know what I'm doing.' Madam Delphi pulsed angrily. 'Wish I could get my head around why the Doctor always surrounds himself with silly humans. I mean, what purpose do you serve? Other than sacrificial lambs. How many travelled in his TARDIS before you, Donna Noble? And what happened to them? I mean, you reckon you're going to travel with him for ever. You think you're the first to believe that? Course you're not. But you're here and they're not.

Wonder what happened to all of them, then?' Donna wasn't going to let this get under her skin – mainly cos that was a question she'd asked the Doctor before and she'd been more than satisfied with his response.

But it clearly struck a chord with her granddad.

'Sweetheart, that's a good question.' 'Really, it's not right now, is it?' she snapped back.

'Is there a churchyard with tombstones, all lined up with their names on them, d'you think, Donna?' said Madam Delphi. 'Got a plot of land saved for you, has he?' 'Maybe,' Donna replied. 'I don't much care, to be honest. I live for the here and now. And right here, right now, all I can be bothered to worry about is stopping you and your little army of zombies here.' 'Destroy them,' Madam Delphi said, so matter-of- factly, so casually, that it took Donna a second for it to sink in.

But sink in it did when the disciples, as one, raised their arms, ready to fire their bolts of energy.

Nothing happened.

'Destroy them!' shrieked the computer.

Still nothing happened.

'Destroy him,' Madam Delphi demanded, but the disciples did nothing except frown and look around themselves in surprise. It was as if they'd just awoken from a dream.

'Ah,' said the Doctor, 'that'll be me. Well, actually if I'm being honest, it'll be a lovely lady called Miss Oladini – never got her first name, very rude of me. Anyway, she's just knocked your alignment off a bit, cancelled out all the power you have over the descendents of San Martino, en masse. Clos, kaput.' ' Finito,' Donna said in a cod Italian accent.

'And that's not all!' Donna looked to her left. Dara Morgan was standing to one side, a laptop in his hands, his fingers flying over the keys as he typed one-handed. 'I've sent out a cancellation signal via the net to the M-TEKs everywhere. As soon as they are synched with computers, instead of downloading your orders, they'll install a virus, which will defrag the platform, and erase their memories completely.' Dara Morgan tapped the return key one last time. 'And I've password protected it.' 'I'm a megalomaniac supercomputer, linked to billions of electronic outlets throughout the world, you silly little man. You really think you've stopped me? I'm disappointed in you, Dara Morgan.' Dara Morgan shrugged. 'Stopped you for good? Doubt it, but I've certainly slowed you down, so the signal won't be activated in ten minutes. Probably not for a few days now – plenty of time for the Doctor to stop you.' Dara Morgan smiled. 'And my name is Callum Fitzhaugh.' A deep electronic sigh came from Madam Delphi.

'Caitlin?' And the Irish girl, Callum's beloved who had rejected him nearly ten years before, drew her revolver from her waistband and raised it.

'Caitlin, don't,' Callum yelled. 'Fight the Mandragora influence. Remember who you really are!' Caitlin frowned. 'Cal?' 'Yes, it's me!' Caitlin shrugged. 'Never liked you then, don't much like you now.' And she fired one bullet that went through Callum Fitzhaugh's brain and out the other side.

He was dead before he hit the carpeted floor.

The newly awoken disciples screamed and yelled in confusion and started to run out of the room.

'Go with them,' Donna hissed to the Carnes boys. 'Get out of here – Lukas, you get Joe home. Don't stop running till you get there.' She turned to Wilf. 'You too.' 'Blow that, Donna my girl. I'm too old to run and I'm here with you to the end. Told your father I'd look after you, and by God I will.' It occurred to Donna that the Caitlin woman could have opened fire by now, so she looked to see what she was doing. She had placed the gun on the desktop and now sat facing Madam Delphi's screens.

The Doctor walked past Donna, almost incidentally easing Netty into Wilf's arms, muttering, 'Hold her tight, Wilf. Like your life depends on it.' He then crouched down beside Caitlin, snaking his hand out for the gun.

'Take it,' she said quietly. 'Callum and I have done enough damage to warrant what I did.' 'You were under the control of Mandragora,' the Doctor said. 'I broke him free of it, he broke you free.' And Caitlin looked him in the eye, a tear rolling down her cheek. 'Madam Delphi never controlled me.

Mandragora never controlled me, it didn't need to.' 'Then who told you to shoot Dara Morgan or whatever his name was?' Donna asked.

'His mind has been... slipping for days. He was beginning to remember things... he was a weak link. I had to eliminate him.' 'You had to what? Why? He might have just saved the human race! Is that what this has all been about?' And Caitlin suddenly looked the Doctor straight in the eye. 'I don't know,' she said, a tear starting to well up.

'What have I become? What has working for this thing done to me? I just killed someone. Oh my God... I just shot him without thinking.' 'Bit late for tears, chum,' Donna said. 'Working with Mandragora, you've probably killed loads of people.' 'I know,' Caitlin said quietly. 'I was out of control, hungry for... for power. I wanted control over my life.' 'I control everything,' Madam Delphi pulsed back.

'Including your life!' 'No you don't, you stupid box of wires. I chose this life because I thought I wanted it. But you know what, I got it wrong.' Her fingers were flying over the keyboard now.

'I'm shutting down the wireless, putting up your firewalls.' 'That won't stop me.' 'No, But it'll isolate you for a bit.' Caitlin looked sadly at the Doctor. 'I've done my bit Mr Time Lord. It's up to you now.' And she pushed her chair back and knocked into the Doctor. Apologising, she moved around him and walked over to Callum's dead body. 'We could've had the world,' she said as she knelt beside him.

The Doctor tried to make sense of Caitlin's words.

Wireless. Firewalls. Pointless things, Madam Delphi was a far more powerful computer than that. He tapped the keyboard and a blast of purple Mandragora energy nearly took his fingers off. 'Now now, don't get grumpy.' 'I will still destroy you, Doctor. You will be—' And she fell silent.

Then he saw what Caitlin had really done. She'd talked nonsense, knowing that Madam Delphi would waste a few subroutines tracking down what she'd claimed to have done. Having found the firewalls and wireless untouched, the computer was now looking elsewhere. It would keep her silent and occupied for... well, not long, frankly.

But there was a calculation going on, he could see it on one of the screens, it was like a mini-virus itself, a self- replicating mathematical equation that was using up bytes with each passing second as, by trying to solve the equation, it actually multiplied it. The Doctor grinned.

Caitlin was good at what she did, even if it would only take Madam Delphi another few seconds to counter it. He glanced towards Callum's body, expecting to see Caitlin.

The body was alone.

The Doctor felt his pockets. The revolver was still there. But something else wasn't.

'Donna,' he hissed. 'Donna, I want you to get down to the lobby. All those people will be confused, disorientated.

Half of them might not even speak English for all we know. They need someone cool and rational to sort them out, explain things to them.' 'But as no one fitting that description is available,' Donna said, 'I'll have to do it.' The Doctor grinned at her. 'Oh Donna, you're the best there is. Now, off you go – no, not you, Wilf. You and Netty stay here.' 'Why can't they come with me?' Donna asked sharply.

'Family matters,' the Doctor said. 'Trust me, they'll both be downstairs safe and sound with me in a few minutes.' 'But...' Wilf stepped up to the plate. 'Go on, Donna, don't argue with the man. When's he ever let you down?' Donna went.

'Might not have been the best choice of words, Wilfred.' 'You ever let her down, Doctor?' 'Well...' the Doctor considered. 'No, actually, but it's been close once or twice.' 'Cos if I ever thought you'd let my little girl down, you'd have me to answer to.' Their eyes met, across the room and, for the tiniest second, a fragment of eternity, the Doctor knew never, ever to let Donna Noble down.

'I won't,' he said. 'In fact, Wilf, I should say “we” won't, cos you're important right now. To Donna. To me.

To the whole wide world. And most of all, to Henrietta Goodhart.' He suddenly stood up. 'Don't do it, Caitlin.' Wilf realised the Irish girl was over by a wall, next to a junction box, holding a silver pen. With a blue tip that was glowing. 'What's she up to, then?' 'You don't know how to use it, Caitlin,' the Doctor said slowly. 'And Madam Delphi's gonna be up and running again in a second. She'll stop you.' 'Let her try,' Caitlin said. 'And you're right, I don't know how to use it, but I reckon if I push this, twist that and shove it all in there...' 'Cait, no!' It was too late. As the sonic screwdriver suddenly shrieked with power, too much power, mishandled, used by untrained hands, Caitlin shoved it into the now- exposed junction box, and right into the fibre-optic cables that Johnnie Bates had died linking up only a few days earlier.

There was a flash of purple fire and Caitlin was gone, reduced to atoms along with a chunk of the wall, the cabling and the Doctor's sonic screwdriver.

'Right idea,' the Doctor said mournfully, 'but there had to be a better way.' 'That computer's gone off,' Wilf said.

The Doctor looked at the screens, and dived down to examine the server. 'Dead as a doornail,' he confirmed.

'We won?' 'Oh, not at all.' The Doctor looked at Wilf. 'I lied to Donna,' he confessed.

'I know,' Wilf said. 'But you made sure she was safe.

Thank you.' 'Caitlin cut off the Mandragora energy from the computer. To all intents and purposes, Madam Delphi is gone. Erased. Destroyed.' 'But that Mandragora energy stuff, it's still there, isn't it?' 'Trapped.' 'Where?' 'In this room. And right now, it's looking for a new home. I reckon we've got about three minutes.' 'It won't choose me, that's why you kept me here. I heard what you said. I have a heart condition. I'm gonna die.' 'What?' The Doctor frowned, then remembered what he said earlier to Madam Delphi. 'Wilfred, I have no idea about the condition of your heart one way or another.

You've could have a couple more decades in you at least, for all I know. I was just saying that because – well, doesn't matter right now.' He glanced at the missing chunk of wall where Caitlin had been standing. 'Now, I doubt it can bring back the dead, so I'm hoping it goes for the easiest target, the path of least resistance.' Wilf followed the Doctor's point of view to Netty, stood smiling serenely beside him.

'No...' 'It's the most likely vessel.' Wilf was shaking with sadness. 'But it's my Netty. We were going to see the world, go on a cruise, do South America, Canada, the Indian Ocean. Doctor, she's my life.

I never thought anyone could replace my wife, God rest her soul, but Netty Goodhart came along and showed me that there's more to living than sitting in a vegetable patch listening to Dusty Springfield. I can't lose her. I can't lose another lady from my life. I love her!' 'I know you do, and I'm really sorry to ask this of her, but I have to.' 'You can't ask her, she's... she's shut off right now. It's the illness, the dementia. She can't speak for herself.' The Doctor reached into his pocket and took out a piece of paper.

Wilf looked at it.

My Darling Wilfred.

You told me once you trusted the Doctor with Donna's life. Now trust him with mine. I don't know what he's going to do, nor what state I'll be in when he does it, but if you trust him, that's good enough for me.

HG 'It's your special paper,' Wilf said. 'Shows me what I want to see. Donna told me about it, ages ago.' The Doctor mouthed a silent 'oh thank you very much, Donna', then produced his leather wallet with the real psychic paper in it. 'No, Wilfred, the letter's genuine.

When we were at that burger place I explained to Netty what might be needed. Why she was a potential target and a potential—' The Doctor broke off, and Wilf saw a momentary purple flash of fire shoot through his eyes. He then screwed them tight and opened them again. Brown. As always.

The Doctor blew air out of his cheeks. 'That wasn't fun, but it won't try me again.' 'No need,' said Henrietta Goodhart, quietly but with a familiar menace to her tone. 'I have a new home. A new body. One that can move, and talk, and feel.' 'Get out of my lady-friend,' Wilf snapped.

Netty just laughed. 'You poor pathetic deluded man.

This is my vessel now. Mandragora lives. I shall reign down destruction upon this world, I shall have my revenge. This entire cosmos will fall into ruin and chaos and I shall feed off it for centuries. Beautiful chaos!' Wilf took a step towards Netty, but the Doctor pulled him back, gave an almost imperceptible shake of his head.

'Wait.' The Doctor looked over at the burnt wall where Caitlin had died. Then at the computer, now useless and dead. At Callum Fitzhaugh's body, so consumed by rage and despair once upon a time, he had given succour to a universal blight that was about to destroy Earth, given a chance. And at Henrietta Goodhart's body, inhabited now by an alien power so great, it had survived since the Dark Times and was now ready to wreak a wave of annihilation across the known galaxies.

Unless he had got his calculations right.

Netty walked around the room, as if nothing were wrong with her, a strong, fit woman in her late sixties, who should have been yomping across the Yorkshire Dales or sunning herself on a Caribbean cruise, Wilfred Mott as her companion, at her side.

Instead, she coughed. She staggered.

Wilf went to help, but the Doctor yanked him back.

'I'm sorry, I can't begin to imagine how hard this is for you,' the Doctor told him, 'but you have to let it play out.' Netty, or rather the alien life force currently inhabiting her mind and body, grinned at them. It was a grin neither of them liked much. It twisted Netty's face in a way that demonstrated absolutely that this was not Netty at all.

'Thank you, Doctor,' she gloated. 'You have given me a whole new lease of life. I always knew the computer was a means to an end, that one day the right host would come along. Having studied this ridiculous planet, I'd rather hoped it'd be a young, sexy, male body. Like a TV soap star or a sportsman. But hey, little old ladies will do for now. When this one is burned up, I'll move on to another.' 'Burned up?' Wilf looked at the Doctor, but the Time Lord's gaze was firmly fixed on Netty. Whether this was for a reason other than not being able to deal with Wilf's accusatory stare, Wilf had no idea.

'Oh, didn't your alien mate here tell you about that side of things? I wonder if he told Henrietta Goodhart when he made the deal with her. You see, Wilf – I may call you Wilf, mayn't I? Only Netty is terribly fond of you, and I think it makes things easier if we communicate casually.

Mr Mott is terribly formal.' The rictus grin got wider.

'Anyway, the human body can only withstand Mandragora energy for a short time before it evaporates and I have to find a new repository. Ultimately, it will be the Doctor.' 'Will it? Oh joy.' 'You know it will.' 'But you need to weaken my defences first, of course.

Batter me down, break my spirit. How're you going to do that, then?' Netty laughed – it was a sound utterly devoid of warmth or genuine mirth. 'By destroying everyone you know.' She suddenly looked unsteady on her feet, and reached out to Wilf for support. He was about to supply it when the Doctor bounded across the room, knocking Wilf's arm away.

'Oi!' 'Oh, don't you start,' the Doctor muttered. 'Let her stand on her own two feet.' Netty was steady again. 'Starting with this old man with the bad heart.' Wilf was about to speak – and then it dawned on him why the Doctor had made up the stuff about his heart.

He'd wanted it to take Netty's body, not Wilf's.

Why? 'Once upon a time, Doctor, we saw this world as a threat, it had so much potential. We tried to stop it developing, hold back its early sciences. But look at it now! We were wrong, we should have encouraged it further. It has the ability to communicate. With one tiny computer virus, Mandragora can touch the world. There are almost seven billion people on Earth, Doctor. In a couple of years, two billion homes will have a personal computer within them, accessed on average by three people. Add to that infiltration into the workplace and it will take Mandragora less than an hour to effectively dominate the majority of people in this planet, to use human technology to spread Mandragora across the galaxy far more efficiently than I can do it alone. In twenty years, I could have humanity building farms on Mars. In a hundred years' time, we could colonise Alpha Centauri. A new Mandragoran Empire, combining Helix energy, human physicality and communications science.

And then... then...' 'It's impressive, I'll grant you. Then what?' 'What does any species do? It flourishes, it dominates it... sort of... keeps going.' 'Oh, “sort of keeps going”, that's very scientific.' The Doctor sat on the chair in front of the now useless Madam Delphi set-up. 'And? Tell me more of your plans. Wilfred here is desperate to know. So am I. And Donna, she's just outside the door – hello, Donna, come back in – I'm sure she wants to know, too.' Donna showed herself. 'I thought I could be more help up here. All those weirdos, I ushered into the staff restaurant, told 'em I'd be back in a minute.' 'Umm, Donna,' the Doctor cautioned, 'what's to stop them running away?' Donna held up a little silver key and waved it in front of his nose. 'Cos I'm brilliant and locked 'em in.' She grinned. 'Oh, but I sent the Carnes boys home.' 'Good, good. Mandragora here was just telling me how he/she/it is going to create a whole new empire. Like the Byzantine Empire, or, um, what was that other one? Greek? No... Oh, what was it?' Donna opened her mouth to suggest 'Roman' but the Doctor stopped her.

'Now, now, Donna, let Mandragora work it out. Come on, you've got all that information at your fingertips, what's the empire I'm thinking of? Something to do with a Decline and a Fall, wasn't it?' Netty/Mandragora paused. Then: 'Roman. The Roman Empire.' 'Oh yes, very good. How many billions of computers are there on Earth now? What was the market infiltration of the M-TEK, by the way?' Netty/Mandragora frowned, and turned to Donna's granddad. 'Wilf? Help me...' 'Netty...?' 'No, Wilfred,' the Doctor said loudly, his voice suddenly like a gunshot. 'Sit down, leave Netty to work it out. Now!' And Wilf settled next to Donna, on the floor.

'Where is Mandragora from?' Netty/Mandragora smiled. 'A nebula, Doctor. We escaped the Dark Times and created a new home in the heart of beautiful chaos.' 'Of course you did. What was it called?' 'The... it was... I can't remember...' Netty/Mandragora staggered slightly. 'We can't remember...' 'Come on, focus,' the Doctor yelled suddenly, and he was up, circling Netty/Mandragora, firing questions as he walked around.

'Tell me the speed of light? How many years did the Carrionite-Eternals war rage? Where is the home world of the Judoon? What's the Twenty-Third Convention of the Shadow Proclamation? Who won the Bendrome/Sendrome War? How many beans make five? Come on, come on...' he clicked his fingers impatiently. 'I mean, you can hardly take over the universe if you can't think for yourself, can you?' 'Give me a moment...' Netty/Mandragora spat.

'Give you a moment? Well, I could give you a moment, I s'pose, I mean, I'd give Henrietta Goodhart a moment or two happily, because she's not well, is she? Oh, didn't you realise? Hadn't you sussed that bit out?' And the Doctor roughly grabbed Netty's shoulders and swung her round so they were face to face, noses almost touching. 'You've taken on the body of a rather amazing lady, Mandragora, and you've locked yourself away in her mind, spreading out into her synapses and everything. Trouble is, the synapses are failing her. Each and every day the neurons and synapses in her cerebral cortex are atrophying. And you're speeding the process up in your hurry to acclimatise yourself and, sadly, you're already breaking up. I mean you can't think of words – that's a touch of paraphasia coming on. Unsteady on your feet? Well, I think that's apraxia. Temporal lobe, parietal lobe, decaying around you.' 'You... you did something... tricked... you tricked me...' 'Well... yes, I think I did. And the more you fight it, the more Mandragora energy you spend trying to repair those bits of brain, the more you're actually losing yourself, because this lady has Moderate Alzheimer's and that's not curable, even by you.' 'Then I shall, you know, change... move, swap bodies with... I shall...' 'Yes? What? What will you do? Go on, tell me.' Donna joined in. 'Or you could tell us all about the stars, all those marvellous constellations, all the things that Netty knows about. Tell us where the Dog Star is? Or how to find the Big Dipper. What direction will I see Venus in at this time of year?' Wilf grabbed Donna's arm. 'Stop it, Donna, you're confusing her.' 'That's the idea,' she told him. 'That's what the Doctor's doing this for, speeding up the confusion.' 'But it's Netty... you're hurting Netty!' Wilf couldn't move. He knew that Donna and the Doctor knew what they were doing, but it didn't stop him wanting them to stop. Wanting to do anything other than have Netty used and abused in this way. But he didn't.

Because, as he'd once read in a newspaper advice column, 'sometimes the greatest good can come out of the smallest pain.' Actually it had probably said 'life's full of hard knocks', but that was how he'd chosen to interpret it.

He just hated it.

For one teeny tiny second, he almost hated the Doctor and Donna for doing it so... easily.

And then he made a decision.

'When the stars begin to fall,' he began to sing quietly, 'Oh Lord! What a morning. Oh Lord! What a morning...' His voice cracked slightly, so he cleared his throat and began again. 'When the stars begin to fall, Oh Lord! What a morning. Oh Lord! What a morning. When the stars begin to fall...' Gently, quietly, Netty's voice responded. 'Oh sinner, what will you do, when the stars begin to fall... Oh Lord! What a morning...' Wilf reached out and took her hand, trying to hide his tears as he did so.

This time the Doctor didn't pull him away. Wilf started slow, stumbling dance steps with Netty, as the two of them sang quietly together the song that she so loved.

The Doctor eased Donna back. 'It's up to your granddad now,' he whispered.

'D'you remember where we first heard this song?' Wilf said to Netty as they danced. 'Who sang it? What was the name of the man who brought us dinner? Can you remember the car, all silver and shining? And was that the first time you'd ever been driven in a Rolls Royce? And what I said at the end, as we drove through the streets, looking up at that clear, beautiful sky? And can you—' 'I... I can't... I can't remember... I am Mandr... Mandragora... I will rule the universe... somehow... I can't...' 'You are Henrietta Goodhart,' Wilf said gently. 'And you are ill, so terribly, terribly ill, and I'm so scared I'm gonna lose you and I don't want to lose you. Please stay.' 'Wilfred?' The Doctor and Donna immediately perked up as Netty spoke his name.

'You're Wilfred... and I'm Netty... no, I'm the Mandragora Helix, and I... Oh Lord! What a morning...' Wilf pulled her tightly to him, and hugged her more than he had ever hugged anyone since his beloved Eileen had passed away. 'Oh sinner, what will you do,' he sang back.

'My head... I don't understand... I can't remember anything...' Netty pushed him away. 'Why can't I remember? It's not fair... It's not fair! I can't remember anything... it's not fair!!' Netty's head dropped backwards and she looked up at the ceiling, bringing both her hands up to point in the direction she was looking. The others watched as screaming purple, blue, red light roared from her body, utterly vaporising a space in the ceiling as the Mandragora energy erupted from Netty's human form and streaked up into the sky.

Then the noise and light cut off.

Mandragora was gone.

Netty's hands fell limply to her sides, and her head lolled forward.

Wilf went to catch her, but Netty just shook herself and looked up at him, a huge smile of recognition on her face.

'Wilfred?' She looked around the hotel penthouse, saw the perfect hole in the ceiling, then spotted the Doctor and Donna.

'Blimey O'Reilly,' she said. 'Have I been Sundowning again? Where on earth have I wandered off to this time?' 'You, Henrietta Goodhart,' the Doctor smiled, 'just saved planet Earth. You're brilliant.' Donna nudged him. 'Yeah. And you're not so useless yourself, spaceman.' A hundred miles. A thousand miles. A million miles.

Moving almost at the speed of thought, the fractured, disembodied Mandragora Helix shot across the universe, screaming inside, its mind falling apart, trying to find its way home.

But where was home? Surely it was... No, it was... Where was home? Where was here? Who am I? What am I? Why am I? Who... what... where... how... I think therefore I am... I think therefore... I think... I... What is 'I'... Nothing... 'I' is nothing... I... I... i... ... .. .

In the canteen, Donna had taken charge, and she soon had everyone relaxed and sorted out, which was a relief for the Doctor – she was much better at this human touchy-feely stuff than him. More importantly right now, she could lie far more convincingly, tell them it'd all been part of a computer virus sent out by MorganTech and that they could go back home as soon as it was daylight.

The Doctor had made a couple of quick calls to people he knew in high places (or maybe low ones) and announced that someone would be arriving very soon to give everyone air tickets and first-class reservations to wherever they wanted to go.

'This is England,' the old American man had muttered.

'I always wanted to come to England. How on earth did I get here?' The Doctor couldn't answer that one but instead fobbed him and his lovely wife off by saying he'd arranged for them to stay in a hotel (not this one, thank God) in the centre of town, and they had a seven-day pass to explore the city. 'Take the train out, go visit Bath, or Warwick or the Isle of Wight.' 'Or Hull,' Donna had added.

'Donna, why would they want to go to Hull? What's in Hull that they could possibly want to see?' 'I dunno,' she said. 'I've never been to Hull. But I always thought it sounded interesting.' 'Hull's lovely,' Wilf joined in. 'Went there for a long weekend once, to see a match. Went out on a boat.' The Doctor gave in. 'All right,' he said to the Americans. 'Go to Hull, too. It has boats. Apparently.' The elderly couple went off muttering about Hull, and the Doctor turned his attention to the students. Three guys and a girl.

'What happened to the Professor?' asked the girl.

The two guys at the back (oh, so a couple, Donna decided) nodded, but the other man looked downcast. 'He died, didn't he?' The Doctor nodded. 'Italian man? Yes, I'm sorry.' The students all stared at each other. 'I don't see any point in going back to Italy.' 'I do,' said the smaller guy at the back, looking at the other.

Ahhh, thought Donna.

'We should at least tie up loose ends out there,' the third guy said.

And the group wandered off, muttering together.

The Greek man was apologetic, saying he had no recollection of what he'd done, but guessed it hadn't been good. The Doctor explained it wasn't his fault and that he should go back to his family and forget about London.

The man wandered off, muttering.

'Suppose he did something back in Greece? Suppose any of them did? Or all of them?' Donna said.

'I can't sort everything out, Donna.' He sighed. 'We can only hope that whatever has happened in their pasts, if anything, they can come to terms with it. And they're unlikely to actually remember.' 'You're thinking of your friend at Copernicus, aren't you?' 'One of them killed him. Broke his neck. Our Greek friend seems the most likely, but I'm not a policeman. And I can't prove anything.' Donna pondered on the morality of it when her mobile phone bleeped. A text.

'Miss Oladini,' Donna waved her mobile at him. She read the text.

'Is she all right?' the Doctor asked.

'She's ecstatic. What did you do?' 'Dunno what you mean.' 'Doctor?' 'Well, perhaps while I was sorting things out with UNIT for that lot, I may possibly have mentioned how indebted we all were to her, too.' 'She says here,' Donna smiled, 'that she's had her visitor's status upgraded and can now come and go as she pleases. No more hiding. Oh, and she also says to tell you she has a cat called Dolly, and that you know what that means.' The Doctor beamed. 'Good for them both.' 'Thought you didn't like cats much?' 'I always liked Dolly. And she deserves a good home.' 'Doctor? How many other people did Madam Delphi use and then chuck away?' 'Mankind were just tools to the Helix, tools to be used and abandoned.' 'Like Netty?' The Doctor visibly winced.

'I'm sorry,' Donna said. 'That was below the belt.' The Doctor looked at his friend. 'But true, and honest. I had to take the risk, Donna. Once, I might've done it with less conscience.' 'My God,' Donna said in mock horror. 'What have I done to you?' The Doctor was serious. He took her hands in his.

'Made me a better person.' Donna pulled her hands away, resorting, as always, to her standard jokes. 'Now then, don't touch what you can't afford, spaceman.' They watched as Wilf and Netty started walking towards the main reception area. 'Let's get them back to your mum, eh?' Donna nodded. 'You coming too, then? I mean, you know what she's like.' The Doctor nodded. 'Yeah. An older version of her daughter.' 'Oi!' Donna laughed and linked arms with the Doctor.

'Come on, spaceman. You've stared down Sontarans, Pyroviles and the Fishmen of Kandalinga. I don't really think my mum's that scary.' 'You don't?' 'Nah. Unless it's Monday. Mondays, she gets one of her 'mares on. Is today Monday?' 'Today is indeed Monday.' Donna held him a bit tighter. 'My turn to protect you then, eh?'
